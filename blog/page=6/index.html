<section class='post-content entry-content'>
<p>A week ago in Tokyo, we held the third RDO Community Meetup at the
OpenStack Summit. We had about 70 people in attendance, and some good
discussion. The full agenda for the meeting is at <a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-tokyo">https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-tokyo</a> and below are some of the things that were discussed. (The complete recording is at the bottom of this post.)</p>

<p>People who were in attendance, please feel free to <a href="https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/blob/master/source/blog/2015-11-04-community-meetup-at-openstack-tokyo.html.md">update and annote</a> your section of this report if you wish to add detail, or if I get anything wrong.</p>

<p>We started with a discussion of how the project is governed. It was observed that although we have a <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-November/msg00028.html">weekly meeting</a>, it's not always possible for everyone to attend, but that these meetings are summarized back to the mailing list each week.</p>

<p>We announced that the new RDO website is live (you're looking at it now!) and that it is possible to <a href="https://github.com/rbowen/rdo-website">send pull requests</a> for it now.</p>

<p>Haikel asked whether there was any interest in his project of an RDO aarch64 port, and identified a few people who expressed interest.</p>

<p>Trown talked a bit about the status of <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/rdo-manager/">RDO-Manager</a> in Liberty. Liberty is the first release where RDO-Manager has released at the same time, which is a big step. He briefly discussed the RDO Manager quickstart that is being worked on. Check back here later for a link to Trown's more detailed writeup.</p>

<p>Regarding the question of the relationship between RDO Manager and TripleO, it was established that RDO Manager is a downstream of TripleO, rather than being an upstream effort. It's more than just TripleO, but, rather, is a distribution of several tools, built on top of TripleO.</p>

<p>We spoke briefly about documenting what all of the moving pieces of the RDO project are, and how they fit together. Haikel said that he's made a start at documenting this, and drawing diagrams. He also encourage people to step up to participate in both documenting, and in improving the infrastructure.</p>

<p>A discussion arose about what the process is to get an upstream patch into RDO. From this, an <a href="https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues/213">action item</a> was raised to more clearly document what the process is to request patches, and where to <a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO">file tickets</a>.</p>

<p>We discussed the timing and frequency of test days in the Mitaka cycle, and this was later discussed more on IRC. The consensus was that there should be a test day about a week after each milestone, with a sanity check done during that week so that we don't have a catastrophic test day. Now that the <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mitaka_Release_Schedule">Mitaka release schedule is published</a> we should be able to put together a tentative <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/">test day schedule</a> very soon.</p>

<p>An overview was given of the <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Rpm-packaging">RPM packaging</a> effort in upstream OpenStack.</p>

<p>The relationship with CentOS was discussed, in particular the manual process required to push packages up to the repos. This process still requires that we ping the CentOS admins, but this will soon be an automated process. Haikel also enumerated the various reasons that the relationship with CentOS is still of great benefit to RDO, including exposure to a wider audience due to CentOS's recognized name. There was also a view expressed that we should run an RDO-based cloud, perhaps in addition to the CentOS infrastructure, so that we are testing on our own platform.</p>

<p>Finally, Rich Megginson spoke about the data aggregation effort that he is working on with Tushar Katarki. Rich has written <a href="http://richmegginson.livejournal.com/27696.html">a more detailed writeup of that section</a>.</p>

<p>Finally, a quick announcement was made of the upcoming <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-November/msg00027.html">RDO Community Day at FOSDEM</a>.</p>

<p>If you'd like to hear more detail from the meetup, I've put the <a href="http://drbacchus.com/podcasts/openstack/rdo_meetup_tokyo.mp3">complete recording</a> up, and you can listen below. (59 minutes, 109 MB)</p>

<p><strong>Why the Operating System Matters</strong> by Margaret Dawson</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In IT today, we love to note that the infrastructure layer has become commoditized. This started with virtualization, as we could create many virtual machines within a single physical machine. Cloud has taken us further with a key value proposition of delivering cloud services on any standard server or virtualized environment, enabling easier scalability and faster service delivery, among other benefits.</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack Summit Tokyo – Day 0 (Pre-event)</strong> by Jeff Jameson</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve always enjoyed traveling to Tokyo, Japan, as the people are always so friendly and willing to help. Whether it’s finding my way through the Narita airport or just trying to find a place to eat, they’re always willing to help – even with the language barrier. And each time I visit, I see something new, learn another word (or two) in Japanese, and it all just seems new and exciting all over again. Add in the excitement and buzz of an OpenStack Summit and you’ve got a great week in Tokyo!</p>

<p><strong>A Container Stack for OpenStack (Part 1 of 2)</strong> by Joe Fernandes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open source continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and nowhere is that more evident than at the biannual OpenStack Summit. Over the past couple of years, as OpenStack interest and adoption has grown, we’ve seen another important innovation emerge from the open source community in the form of Linux containers, driven by Docker and associated open source projects. As the world gathers in Tokyo for another OpenStack Summit, we wanted to talk about how Red Hat is bringing these two innovations together, to make OpenStack a great platform for running containerized applications.</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack Summit Tokyo – Day 1</strong> by Jeff Jameson</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kon’nichiwa from Tokyo, Japan where the 11th semi-annual OpenStack Summit is officially underway! This event has come a long way from its first gathering, more than five years ago, where 75 people gathered in Austin, Texas to learn about OpenStack in its infancy. That’s a sharp contrast with the 5,000+ people in attendance here in what marks Asia’s second OpenStack Summit.</p>

<p><strong>What does RDO stand for?</strong> by Rich Bowen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The RDO FAQ has long said that RDO doesn't stand for anything. This is a very unsatisfying answer to one of the most frequently asked questions about RDO. So, a little while ago, I started saying that RDO stands for "Rich's Distribution of OpenStack." Although tongue-in-cheek, this response emphasizes that RDO is a community driven project. So it's also Radez's Distribution of OpenStack, and Radhesh's and Russel's and red_trela's. (As well as lots of people whose names don't start with R!)</p>

<p><strong>Proven OpenStack solutions. Simple OpenStack deployment. Powerful results.</strong> by Radhesh Balakrishnan</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to an IDC global survey sponsored by Cisco of 3,643 enterprise executives responsible for IT decisions, 69% of respondents indicated that their organizations have a cloud adoption strategy in place. Of these organizations, 65% say OpenStack is an important part of their cloud strategy and had higher expectations for business improvements associated with cloud adoption.</p>

<p>Once again, OpenStack engineers met to design the Mitaka cycle.
Here is a summary of the <a href="https://security.openstack.org">Security Project</a>
and relevant release mangement changes.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-the-openstack-security-project-">What is the OpenStack Security Project ?</h2>

<p>Security issues, tooling, innovations and education within OpenStack are the responsibility of the Security Project.
The Security Project undertakes technical and governance activities for the OpenStack community,
aiming to provide guidance, information and code that enhances the OpenStack ecosystem's security.</p>

<h2 id="bandit-and-syntribos">Bandit and Syntribos</h2>

<p>The OSSP (OpenStack Security Project) discussed <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/Projects/Bandit">Bandit</a>
and <a href="http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/syntribos">Syntribos</a> developpements.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Bandit is a static analyser for python language whose purpose is to find trivial programing
mistakes and to help enforce strong security guideline.</li>
  <li>Syntribos is an API testing framework that aims to facilitate fault injection tests through REST
interfaces.</li>
</ul>

<p>While Bandit is currently used as a gate job for Keystone, Syntribos is currently being developed
and its usecases are still under constructions.
Overall, roadmap's goals are to get better reporting from the tools, more OpenStack projects
on board and improved stability. Both etherpads used during design sessions are available here: <a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/security-mitaka-worksession-bandit">Bandit worksession</a> and <a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/security-mitaka-worksession-syntribos">Syntribos worksession</a></p>

<h2 id="governance-tag-vulnerabilitymanaged">Governance Tag: vulnerability:managed</h2>

<p>The vulnerability management team <a href="https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html">VMT</a> introduced a new tag <a href="http://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/vulnerability_managed.html">vulnerability:managed</a>
to help identify which projects are being supervised by the team.
The incubation process for new projects is now described <a href="http://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/vulnerability_managed.html#requirements">there</a> and we are looking to have a few more project on board.</p>

<p>In order to help us scale for the big tent, a new downstream stakeholder mailing list will be
created to ease advanced notification workflow (pre-OSSAs).
This list would also be useful for projects that are not yet supported and to warn
stakeholders about upcoming vulnerabilities.</p>

<h2 id="stable-release">Stable Release</h2>

<p>Stable releases such as 2015.1.2 are now gone and will no longer be produced.
Instead, projects will now be able to release new versions independly and security fixes should
be tagged and released right after their merge.
This is a great improvement for all upstream release users and stable release managers as the
process is now streamlined.</p>

<p>Other improvements for release management are to be expected, such as automation of release notes
with <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/reno/">reno</a>, a
<a href="https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator">project explorer</a>
and a handy page of version numbers recap for the <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/releases/releases/liberty.html">last release</a>.</p>

<p>Once again, we have made great progress and I'm looking forward to further developments.
Thank you all for the great OpenStack Mitaka Design Summit!</p>

<p>Tristan Cacqueray</p>

<p>OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team</p>

<p>What does RDO stand for?</p>

<p><img alt="tshirt" src="/images/blog/rdo-tshirt.jpg" /></p>

<p>The <a href="/rdo/faq">RDO FAQ</a> has long said that RDO doesn't stand for
anything. This is a very unsatisfying answer to one of the most
frequently asked questions about RDO. So, a little while ago, I started
saying that RDO stands for "Rich's Distribution of OpenStack." Although
tongue-in-cheek, this response emphasizes that RDO is a community driven
project. So it's also Radez's Distribution of OpenStack, and Radhesh's and Russel's
and red_trela's. (As well as lots of people whose names don't start with R!)</p>

<p>It also stands for "RPM Distribution of OpenStack." And "Really
Deploy OpenStack", and "Rebuilt Daily OpenStack", and a variety of other
things.</p>

<p>So, that's the thinking behind the tshirt that we're giving out at our booth at
OpenStack Summit here in Tokyo. We still have a few left, so drop by the Red
Hat booth and get yours while they last.</p>

<p>Why ducks?</p>

<p>Well, as everyone knows, sometimes, the moment you ask a question
out loud, the obvious answer occurs to you. And often, when
explaining a problem to someone else, you understand it better
yourself.</p>

<p>Red Hat has your back on this. We have ducks at our booth at OpenStack
Summit in Tokyo this week. The benefits of using a rubber duck as part
of your programming work flow are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging">well
documented</a>.</p>

<p>So, come grab a duck, and learn more about RDO, in the OpenStack
Marketplace at <a href="http://openstack.org/summit/">OpenStack Summit</a>.</p>

<p>We are pleased to announce the general availability of the RDO build for
OpenStack Liberty for CentOS Linux 7 x86_64, suitable for building
private, public and hybrid clouds. OpenStack Liberty is the 12th release of the open source software collaboratively built by a large number of
contributors around the OpenStack.org project space.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/">RDO community project</a> curates,
packages, builds, tests and maintains a complete OpenStack component set
for RHEL and CentOS Linux and is a founding member of the <a href="https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud">CentOS Cloud Infrastructure SIG</a>. The Cloud Infrastructure SIG focus on delivering a great user
experience for CentOS Linux users looking to build and maintain their
own onpremise, public or hybrid clouds.</p>

<p>In addition to the comprehensive OpenStack services, libraries and
clients, this release also provides Packstack, a simple installer for
proof-of-concept installations, as small as a single all-in-one box and
<a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/RDO-Manager">RDO Manager</a>, an OpenStack
deployment and management tool for production environments based on the
OpenStack TripleO project.</p>

<h2 id="quickstart">QuickStart:</h2>

<p>Ensure you have a fully updated CentOS Linux 7/x86_64 machine, and run :</p>

<pre class="highlight plaintext"><code>sudo yum install centos-release-openstack-liberty&#x000A;sudo yum install openstack-packstack&#x000A;packstack --allinone&#x000A;</code></pre>

<p>For a more detailed quickstart please refer to the <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/QuickStart">RDO Project hosted
guide</a>.</p>

<p>For RDO Manager consult the <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/RDO-Manager">RDO Manager page</a>.</p>

<p>RDO project is closely tracking upstream OpenStack projects using the <a href="http://trunk.rdoproject.org/">Delorean tool</a> which is producing RPM packages from upstream development
branches.</p>

<p>Since the previous OpenStack Kilo release, RDO is participating
in the Cloud SIG and using CentOS provided infrastructure.
Towards the end of developement cycle packages are imported into <a href="http://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/CommunityBuildSystem">CentOS Cloud SIG buildsystem</a> and get eventually published in <a href="http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/cloud/x86_64/">Cloud SIG repositories</a>.</p>

<h2 id="getting-help">Getting Help:</h2>

<p>The RDO Project provides a Q&amp;A service at ask.openstack.org, for more
developer oriented content we recommend joining the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list">rdo-list mailing list</a>. Remember to post
a brief introduction about yourself and your RDO story.
You can also find extensive documentation <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/documentation">on the RDO website</a>.</p>

<p>We also welcome comments and requests on the <a href="https://lists.centos.org/">CentOS Mailing lists</a> and the CentOS IRC Channels ( #centos on
irc.freenode.net ), however we have a more focused audience in the RDO venues.</p>

<p>To get involved in the OpenStack RPM packaging effort, see <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/Get_involved">the "Get Involved" docs</a> and <a href="https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud">the Cloud SIG docs</a>  Join us in #rdo on the
Freenode IRC network, and follow us at <a href="http://twitter.com/rdocommunity">@RDOCommunity on Twitter</a>. And, if you're going to 
be in Tokyo for the OpenStack Summit next week, join us on Wednesday at
lunch for the <a href="http://sched.co/4MYy">RDO community meetup</a>.</p>

<p>I'd like to thank all RDO developers and CentOS Project for
their effort and support resulting in this release,
especially</p>

<ul>
  <li>dmsimard - for continuously improving RDO CI</li>
  <li>jpena - for keeping Delorean service up and running</li>
  <li>jruzicka - for the rdopkg auto-magic</li>
  <li>number80 - for countless reviews and packaging wisdom</li>
  <li>social - for puppet module mastery</li>
  <li>trown - for leading RDO Manager side of the show!</li>
</ul>

<p>Special thanks to all the folks who helped with last minute testing in
IRC #rdo channel !</p>

<p>Thanks,</p>

<p>Alan Pevec</p>

<p>Cloud SIG and RDO project member</p>

<p>A big thanks to everyone that participated in the <a href="http://beta.rdoproject.org/testday/rdo-test-day-liberty-02/">RDO Test Day</a> over the last 48 hours. Here's a few statistics from the day.</p>

<p>29 people wrote 74 email messages to the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-October/thread.html">rdo-list mailing list</a>. (Of course, they weren't all about the test day, but many of them were.)</p>

<p>42 participants sent a collective 1074 messages to the #rdo IRC channel on Freenode.net. (Likewise, not all about test day.)</p>

<p>We had <a href="http://tm3.org/liberty-test-day-bugs">23 new issues</a> opened in the ticketing system.</p>

<p>Some people have put their day's experience in the <a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo_test_day_oct_2015">etherpad</a> and some have updated the <a href="http://beta.rdoproject.org/testday/testedsetups-liberty-02/">Tested Scenarios page</a>. If you didn't put your notes anywhere, please do update one of those in the coming day or two, so that we don't lose what we learned.</p>

<p>So, thanks to all of you. Particular thanks to trown for getting things rolling and herding the cats.</p>

<p><strong>What’s new in OpenStack Liberty: webinar recap</strong> by Steve Gordon and Sean Cohen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenStack “Liberty,” due for imminent release, represents the 12th release of the open source computing platform for public and private clouds. Recent OpenStack releases have focused on improving stability and enhancing the operator experience. This is still the case with Liberty, but there are still new features to consider.</p>

<p><strong>Minimum Viable Cluster</strong> by Andrew Beekhof</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the past there was a clear distinction between high performance (HP) clustering and high availability (HA) clustering, however the lines have been bluring for some time. People have scaled HA clusters upwards and HP inspired clusters have been used to provide availability through redundancy.</p>
