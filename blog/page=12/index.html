<p>If you're writing about RDO, or about OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora or RHEL, and you're not on my list, please let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Wherein our hero attempts to build his own OpenStack Keystone RPMs</strong>, by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have a Devstack setup. I’ve hacked the Keystone repo to add some cool feature.  I want to test it out with an RDO deployment.  How do I make my own RPM for the RDO system?</p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
  <p>This is not a how to. This is more like a police log.</p>

<p><strong>History of APIs for spawning processes in libvirt without involving the shell</strong>, by Daniel P. Berrangé</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Libvirt has an interesting history when it comes to the spawning of child processes, for a long time eschewing all use of the standard C functions system and popen, instead preferring to use fork+exec via some higher level wrappers of our own design. There were a number of reasons for this decision, some obvious, some not so obvious:</p>

<p><strong>Usage of the libvirt virCommand APIs for process spawning</strong>, by Daniel P. Berrangé</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The previous blog post looked at the history of libvirt APIs for spawning processes, up to the current day where there is a single virCommand object + APIs for spawning processes in a very flexible manner. This blog post will now look at the key features of this API and how it is used in practice.</p>

<p><strong>Network Function Virtualization – The Opportunity for OpenStack and Open Source</strong>, by Mark McLoughlin</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>This week’s launch of OPNFV is a good opportunity to think about a simmering debate in the OpenStack developer community for a while now – what exactly does NFV have to do with OpenStack, and is it a good thing?</p>

<p><strong>Zaqar's path going forward, by Flavio Percoco</strong></p>

<p>Long time since I wrote my last post about Zaqar (ex Marconi) and I thought this one should be a summary of what has happened and what will, probably, happen going forward.</p>

<p>Let me start by sharing where Zaqar is in OpenStack.</p>

<p><strong>Zaqar's pools explained, by Flavio Percoco</strong></p>

<p>Now that I've dedicated time to explain what Zaqar's path going forward is (Zaqar being a messaging service akin to SQS/SNS), I can move on and spend some time diving into some of Zaqar's internals. For this post, I'd like to explain how Zaqar's pools work.</p>

<p><strong>What’s new in OpenStack Juno, by Rich Bowen</strong></p>

<p>OpenStack is on a six-month release cycle, with each release given  a code name starting with consecutive letters of the alphabet. On October 16th, OpenStack Juno will be released, with several new projects, and lots of new features.</p>

<p>Here’s a few of the things you can expect in the next release of
OpenStack. This isn’t intended to be comprehensive – just a taste of
some of the things that are coming.</p>

<p><strong>Journey of IPv6 in OpenStack, by Sridhar Gaddam</strong></p>

<p>In this post, I would like to share my views on how IPv6 support has evolved in OpenStack with references at appropriate places to where you will be able to find more information.  I will try to first cover what is available in IceHouse, then review what has been merged in Juno and then talk about what is brewing for Kilo.</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack Board Meeting – 2014-09-18, by Russell Bryant</strong></p>

<p>Board meetings are open with the exception of the occasional Executive Session for topics that really do need to be private.  I attended the meeting on September 18, 2014.  Jonathan Bryce has since posted a summary of the meeting, but I wanted to share some additional commentary.</p>

<p><strong>PTLs and Project Success in OpenStack, by Russell Bryant</strong></p>

<p>We’re in the middle of another PTL change cycle.  Nominations have occurred over the last week.  We’ve also seen several people step down this cycle (Keystone, TripleO, Cinder, Heat, Glance).  This is becoming a regular thing in OpenStack.  The PTL position for most projects has changed hands over time.  The Heat project changes every cycle.  Nova has its 3rd PTL from a 3rd company (about to enter his 2nd cycle).  With all of this change, some people express some amount of discomfort and concern.</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack Summit Paris: Agenda Confirms 22 Red Hat Sessions, by Jeff Jameson</strong></p>

<p>As this Fall’s OpenStack Summit in Paris approaches, the Foundation has posted the session agenda, outlining the schedule of events. With an astonishing 1,100+ sessions submitted for review, I was happy to see that Red Hat and eNovance have a combined 22 sessions that are included in the weeks agenda, with two more as alternates.</p>

<p><strong>Integrating custom code with Nova using hooks, by Lars Kellogg-Stedman</strong></p>

<p>Would you like to run some custom Python code when Nova creates and destroys virtual instances on your compute hosts? This is possible using Nova's support for hooks, but the existing documentation is somewhat short on examples, so I've spent some time trying to get things working.</p>

<p>bvirt: default network conflicts (not anymore), by Kashyap Chamarthy</p>

<p>Increasingly there’s a need for libvirt networking to work inside a
virtual machine that is already running on the default network
(192.168.122.0/24). The immediate practical case where this comes up is
while testing nested virtualization.</p>

<p>It was with surprise and pleasure that we learned of Oracle's decision to base their <a href="https://blogs.oracle.com/linux/entry/technology_preview_of_icehouse_with">commercial OpenStack offering</a> on the community-supported RDO distribution of OpenStack. (See their packstack-based deployment instructions <a href="http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/server-storage/vm/ovm-linux-openstack-2202503.pdf">here</a>.) We are always happy to see people use our distribution, on which we encourage people to build proof of concept or test deployments of OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora, and Red Hat Enterprise Linux as well as those other derivative distros.</p>

<p>If you experience difficulties with Oracle OpenStack, we encourage you to drop by the <a href="http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=rdo">#RDO channel on Freenode</a> for help in getting it working. The more people using OpenStack, the better, right?</p>

<p>Of course, when you are ready to move to production, we encourage you to move to our production-hardened, ecosystem-supported, enterprise-ready <a href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-US/Red_Hat_Enterprise_Linux_OpenStack_Platform/">Red Hat Enterprise Linux OpenStack Platform</a>, to ensure the best OpenStack experience possible.</p>

<p>And, Oracle, we encourage you to send your fixes back upstream. We look forward to your participation in the RDO community.</p>

<p>Neutron, historically known as Quantum, is the OpenStack project focused
on delivering networking as a service. As the Juno development cycle

Neutron during this exciting cycle and have a look at what is coming up
in the next upstream major release which is set to debut in October.</p>

<p><strong>Visualizing Heat stacks</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I spent some time today learning about Heat autoscaling groups, which are incredibly nifty but a little opaque from the Heat command line, since commands such as heat resource-list don't recurse into nested stacks. It is possible to introspect these resources (you can pass the physical resource id of a nested stack to heat resource-list, for example)…</p>

  <p>Across many enterprise organizations, IT is driving innovation that allows companies to be more agile and gain a competitive edge. These are exciting times for the Vadmins who are at the center of this change. This innovation starts with bridging the gap between traditional virtualization workloads and cloud-enabled workloads based on OpenStack.</p>

<p>Next week, Friday, September 5, 10 am Eastern US time, Lars Kellogg-Stedman will be presenting a Google Hangout on the subject of deploying with Heat. This will be streamed live on YouTube at https://plus.google.com/events/c9u4sjn7ksb8jrmma7vd25aok94 and if the time is not convenient, you will be able to watch it at that same URL after the fact.</p>

<p>Here's the blog posts that came out of the RDO community last week.</p>

<p><strong>Keystone is not an authentication service, by Nathan Kinder</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my previous post about security related updates that are coming in
Juno, I mentioned that Keystone itself is a poor identity management
solution.  I feel that this is a topic that deserves a more thorough
discussion.</p>

<p><strong>TripleO vs OpenStack HA, by Giulio Fidente</strong></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the topics discussed during the TripleO mid-cycle meetup in RDU
was our status in relation to deploying OpenStack in a highly available

reached a usable state.</p>

<p><strong>Layer 3 High Availability, by Assaf Muller</strong></p>

tricks that DHCP offers, and yet the people demand high availability.
So what are people doing?</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack Ceilometer and the Gnocchi experiment, by Julien Danjou</strong></p>
