<p><strong>Troubleshooting Keystone in a New Install</strong>, by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve done a deployment , and every time I try to log in to the dashboard, I get “An error occurred authenticating. Please try again later.” Somewhat surprisingly, the only log that I’m noticing showing anything of note is the Apache error log, which reports ‘Login failed for user “admin”‘. I’ve bumped keystone — where I’d assume the error is happening — to DEBUG, but it’s showing exactly zero activity. How do I go about debugging this?’</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack keeps resetting my hostname</strong>, by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>No matter what I changed, something kept setting the hostname on my vm to federate.cloudlab.freeipa.org.novalocal. Even forcing the /etc/hostname file to be uneditable did not prevent this change. Hunting this down took far too long, and here is the result of my journey.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my prior post, I described how OpenStack from Red Hat frees  you to pursue your business with the peace of mind that your cloud is secure and stable. Red Hat has several products that enhance OpenStack to provide cloud management, virtualization, a developer platform, and scalable cloud storage.</p>

<p><strong>QEMU QCow2 built-in encryption: just say no. Deprecated now, to be deleted soon</strong>, by Daniel Berrange</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A little over 5 years ago now, I wrote about a how libvirt introduced support for QCow2 built-in encryption. The use cases for built-in qcow2 encryption were compelling back then, and remain so today. In particular while LUKS is fine if your disk backend is already a kernel visible block device, it is not a generically usable alternative for QEMU since it requires privileged operation to set it up, would require yet another I/O layer via a loopback or qemu-nbd device, and finally is entirely Linux specific.</p>

<p><strong>Custom Cloud Images for OpenStack pt1</strong>, by Captain KVM</p>

  <p>We previously finished our multi-part series on deploying RHEL-OSP with the RHEL-OSP-Installer. In a few weeks, if all goes according to plan I’ll fire up a new series on the next gen installer… In the mean time, I’d like to show you some useful things to do once you’ve got everything up and running. So what’s up first? Well, as the title suggests, we’re going to create some custom images.</p>

<p><strong>Co-Engineered Together: OpenStack Platform and Red Hat Enterprise Linux</strong>, by Arthur Berezin</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenStack is not a software application that just runs on top of any random Linux. OpenStack is tightly coupled to the operating system it runs on and choosing the right Linux  operating system, as well as an OpenStack platform, is critical to provide a trusted, stable, and fully supported OpenStack environment.</p>

<p><strong>Booting cloud images with libvirt</strong>, by Lars Kellogg-Stedman</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Most major distributions now provide "cloud-enabled" images designed for use in cloud environments like OpenStack and AWS. These images are usually differentiated by (a) being relatively small, and (b) running cloud-init at boot to perform initial system configuration tasks using metadata provided by the cloud environment.</p>

  <p>Last October, I wrote about a particular aspect of providing HA for workloads running on OpenStack. The HA problem space for OpenStack is much more broad than what was addressed there. There has been a lot of work around HA for the OpenStack services themselves. The problems for OpenStack services seem to be pretty well understood.</p>

<p><strong>How to build RedHat 100 node Openstack lab on AWS - Technical write up and talk</strong></p>

<p>This installation was deployed on Red Hat Enterprise Linux 7 (64bit) using the packstack installer. The setup started with one compute, controller and neutron node and was scaled in an automated fashion on AWS to 100 compute nodes, until we hit some interesting issues with some services on controller node. This exercise also describes the scenario of how you can setup Openstack labs(which require KVM) on AWS and Google Cloud with Ravello's nested hypervisor platform with hardware acceleration.</p>

<p><strong>When</strong>: February 26 6-8pm PST</p>

<p><strong>Where</strong>: 2479 E Bayshore Road, Suite 188(left entrance to the bldg), Palo Alto, CA</p>

<p><strong>Nova metadata recorded in libvirt guest instance XML</strong>, by Daniel Berrange</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the issues encountered when debugging libvirt guest problems with Nova, is that it isn’t always entirely obvious why the guest XML is configured the way it is. For a while now, libvirt has had the ability to record arbitrary application specific metadata in the guest XML. Each application simply declares the XML namespace it wishes to use and can then record whatever it wants. Libvirt will treat this metadata as a black box, never attempting to interpret or modify it. In the Juno release I worked on a blueprint to make use of this feature to record some interesting information about Nova.</p>

<p><strong>External networking for Kubernetes services</strong>, by Lars Kellogg-Stedman</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have recently started running some "real" services (that is, "services being consumed by someone other than myself") on top of Kubernetes (running on bare metal), which means I suddenly had to confront the question of how to provide external access to Kubernetes hosted services. Kubernetes provides two solutions to this problem, neither of which is particularly attractive out of the box:</p>

  <p>This is a long-form response to this question, and describes how to get the nova-docker driver up running with devstack under Ubuntu 14.04 (Trusty). I wrote a similar post for Fedora 21, although that one was using the RDO Juno packages, while this one is using devstack and the upstream sources.</p>

  <p>OpenStack has many different code bases.  Figuring out how to run in a debugger can be maddening, especially if you are trying to deal with Eventlet and threading issues.  Adding HTTPD into the mix, as we did for Keystone, makes it even trickier.  Here’s how I’ve been handling things using the remote pythong debugger (rpdb).</p>

  <p>In some ways, the most exciting thing about Docker isn't the ability to start containers. That's been around for a long time in various forms, such as LXC or OpenVZ. What Docker brought to the party was a convenient method of building and distributing the filesystems necessary for running containers. Suddenly, it was easy to build a containerized service and to share it with other people.</p>
