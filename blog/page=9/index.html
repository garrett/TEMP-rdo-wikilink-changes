<p>Here's what RDO engineers have been writing about over the past week.</p>

<p>If you're writing about RDO, or about OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora or RHEL, and you're not on my list, please let me know!</p>

<p><strong>CentOS Cloud SIG announces Kilo and Juno package repos</strong>, by Rich Bowen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The CentOS Cloud SIG is pleased to announce the availability of OpenStack Kilo package repositories for CentOS 7, and Juno repositories for CentOS 6. These are the result of the last few months of work by the Cloud SIG membership, and, of course, we owe a great deal of gratitude to the upstream OpenStack community as well.</p>

<p><strong>Puppet OpenStack plans for Liberty</strong>, by Emilien Macchi</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Our Vancouver week just ended and I think it was a very productive Summit for the Puppet OpenStack folks. This blog post summarizes what we did this week, and what we plan for the next release.</p>

<p><strong>RDO Meetup, OpenStack Summit Vancouver</strong>, by Rich Bowen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Thursday morning at the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver, roughly 60 RDO enthusiasts gathered to discuss a variety of topics around the RDO project. Officially we had just 40 minutes, but since we were followed by a coffee break, we went overtime by about 20 minutes, and there was still some hallway discussion following that.</p>

<p>On Thursday morning at the OpenStack Summit in Vancouver, roughly 60 RDO enthusiasts gathered to discuss a variety of topics around the RDO project. Officially we had just 40 minutes, but since we were followed by a coffee break, we went overtime by about 20 minutes, and there was still some hallway discussion following that.</p>

<p><img alt="" src="https://lh5.googleusercontent.com/-vEtHoB0VaWw/VWSeAzcsSWI/AAAAAAAAK8s/Zi3dVmSHm2w/w937-h527-no/IMG_20150521_101851.jpg" /></p>

<p>The complete agenda can be seen in the <a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO_Vancouver">meeting etherpad</a>. Highlights include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Perry Myers talked some about the packaging effort - the status, and where people can get involved in that. Several people in attendance expressed a desire to get more involved. There was also some talk about how we are going to handle packaging for Fedora in the future.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Jaromir Coufal gave an overview of the <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/RDO-Manager">RDO-Manager</a> project, which is the effort to build an installer/manager for your RDO OpenStack cloud, based on TripleO and other OpenStack projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>There was some discussion around what will be included in future packaging of RDO - for example, whether it will include the newly minted projects such as <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Murano">Murano</a>, <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Congress">Congress</a>, <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mistral">Mistral</a>, and so on. The consensus appears to be that this is up to who steps up to do that work, and so is another incentive to get more people involved in packaging.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Karsten Wade gave an update on the CentOS infrastructure, including the recent release of <a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-May/msg00209.html">CentOS RDO package repositories</a>. Questions here include the relationship between these new repos and the existing RDO repos on repos.fedorapeople.org - the intent is that the repos on mirrors.centos.org will replace these. Karsten also talked about the CentOS project's plan for OpenStack/CentOS CI such that upgrades to CentOS never break OpenStack, and vice versa, if you use these repos.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Following from this, there was discussion of the <a href="https://ci.centos.org/view/rdo/">CI infrastructure</a> which is key to that decision. It was noted that other related projects, such as libvirt, are also using that infrastructure, which could lead to helpful cooperation between the projects.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dan Radez gave an overview of <a href="https://www.opnfv.org/">OPNFV</a> and the plans to integrate it with RDO.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Dan also talked about <a href="http://trystack.org/">TryStack</a>, and the plans to improve it in the months to come.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>In the coming weeks, this website will be migrating off of MediaWiki and Vanilla Forums, to a git-based system using <a href="https://middlemanapp.com/">Middleman</a>. This will make it easier for people to contribute to the content, and will also solve other persistent technical problems related the the current system, authentication, and URL mapping. It will also ensure better historical tracking of content. There was some discussion of plans to reorganize the content of the site to better facilitate community engagement.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Given the quantity of topics, and the lack of time, we talked about trying to do a full-day event at FOSDEM, in conjunction with the CentOS Dojo there, where we could devote an hour to each topic, rather than cutting everyone off after 5 minutes.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of the above items will be discussed further on the mailing list in the coming weeks. The meetup, while very valuable, wasn't long enough to do much more than start conversations and find interested people. Look for these conversations soon - or start one yourself if there's a topic that you're particular interested in.</p>

<p>Once again, a huge thanks to everyone that attended, and everyone that presented topics.</p>

<p>The CentOS Cloud SIG is pleased to announce the availability of OpenStack Kilo package repositories for CentOS 7, and Juno repositories for CentOS 6. These are the result of the last few months of work by the Cloud SIG membership, and, of course, we owe a great deal of gratitude to the upstream OpenStack community as well.</p>

<p>The CentOS 7 Kilo repository may be found at http://mirror.centos.org/centos/7/cloud/x86_64/</p>

<p>The Juno CentOS 6 repository may be found at http://mirror.centos.org/centos/6/cloud/x86_64/</p>

<p>The actual -release files will reside in Extras, so that you can yum install centos-release-openstack-kilo for Kilo and yum install centos-release-openstack-juno for Juno, without needing to mess with repo configurations.</p>

<p>See also the Juno EL6 QuickStart at http://wiki.centos.org/Cloud/OpenStack/JunoEL6QuickStart</p>

<p>CentOS cares about OpenStack. We test all of our cloud images against OpenStack, in the CentOS 5, 6, and 7 branches. The CentOS Cloud SIG is very keen on facilitating community efforts at CentOS, and we have resources available for CI, repos, and other needs, which the community can use. We welcome your participation in this effort. We're dedicated to ensuring that CentOS is a solid, dependable platform for deploying OpenStack, and that all versions of OpenStack are thoroughly tested against CentOS, and vice versa.</p>

<p>You can find out more about the CentOS Cloud SIG, and how to get involved, at http://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud</p>

<p><strong>The Age of Cloud File Services</strong>, by Sean Cohen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The new OpenStack Kilo upstream release that became available on April 30, 2015 marks a significant milestone for the Manila project for shared file system service for OpenStack with an increase in development capacity and extensive vendors adoption. This project was kicked off 3 years ago and became incubated during 2014 and now moves to the front of the stage at the upcoming OpenStack Vancouver Conference taking place this month with customer stories of Manila deployments in Enterprise and Telco environments.</p>

<p><strong>An EZ Bake OVN for OpenStack</strong> by Russell Bryant</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Ben Pfaff pushed the last of the changes needed to make OVN functional to the ovn branch, he dubbed it the “EZ Bake milestone”.  The analogy is both humorous and somewhat accurate.  We’ve reached the first functional milestone, which is quite exciting.</p>

<p>If you're writing about RDO, or about OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora or RHEL, and you're not on my list, please let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Leveraging Linux Platform for Identity Management in Enterprise Web Applications</strong>, by Nathan Kinder</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I gave a presentation this past weekend at Linuxfest Northwest on the topic of using a collection of Apache HTTPD modules and SSSD to provide identity management for web applications.   This is an approach that is currently used by OpenStack, ManageIQ, and Foreman to allow the Apache HTTPD web server to handle all of the authentication and retrieval of user identity data and exposing it to the web applications.</p>

<p><strong>Driving in the Fast Lane – CPU Pinning and NUMA Topology Awareness in OpenStack Compute</strong>, by  Steve Gordon</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The OpenStack Kilo release, extending upon efforts that commenced during the Juno cycle, includes a number of key enhancements aimed at improving guest performance. These enhancements allow OpenStack Compute (Nova) to have greater knowledge of compute host layout and as a result make smarter scheduling and placement decisions when launching instances. Administrators wishing to take advantage of these features can now create customized performance flavors to target specialized workloads including Network Function Virtualization (NFV) and High Performance Computing (HPC).</p>

<p><strong>Extending Tsung to benchmark Swift3</strong>, by  Cyril Roelandt</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tsung is a multi-protocol distributed load testing tool released under the
GPLv2 license. In this article, we will see how we can create a scenario that
triggers the download of a file from a Swift container using the S3 API. In
fact, we are using Swift3, a compatibility layer that implements the S3 API
on top of OpenStack Swift. To do so, we will have to use some of the advanced
features of Tsung, but people not familiar with either Tsung or Erlang
should still be able to enjoy this article.</p>

<p><strong>Setting up an RDO deployment to be Identity V3 Only</strong>, by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The OpenStack Identity API Version 3 provides support for many features that are not available in version 2. Much of the installer code from Devstack, Puppet Modules, and Packstack, all assumes that Keystone is operating with the V2 API. In the interest of hastening the conversion, I set up a deployment that is V3 only. Here is how I did it.</p>

  <p>A while ago, I had made a quick article/demo of how to use Ceilometer instead of the built-in emulated Amazon CloudWatch resources of Heat.</p>

<p><strong>What’s Coming in OpenStack Networking for the Kilo Release</strong>, by Nir Yechiel</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenStack  Kilo, the 11th release of the open source project, was officially released in April, and now is a good time to review some of the changes we saw in the OpenStack Networking (Neutron) community during this cycle, as well as some of the key new networking features introduced in the project.</p>

<p><strong>A Vision for OpenStack</strong> by Zane Bitter</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the great things about forcing yourself to write down your thoughts is that it occasionally produces one of those lightbulb moments of clarity, where the jigsaw pieces you have been mentally turning over suddenly all fit together. I had one of those this week while preparing my platform for the OpenStack Technical Committee election.</p>

<p><strong>Implementation of Pacemaker Managed OpenStack VM Recovery</strong>, by Russell Bryant</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve discussed the use of Pacemaker as a method to detect compute node failures and recover the VMs that were running there.  The implementation of this is ready for testing.  Details can be found in this post to rdo-list.</p>

<p><strong>OVN and OpenStack Integration Development Update</strong>, by Russell Bryant</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Open vSwitch project announced the OVN effort back in January.  After OVN was announced, I got very interested in its potential.  OVN is by no means tied to OpenStack, but the primary reason I’m interested is I see it as a promising open source backend for OpenStack Neutron.  To put it into context with existing Neutron code, it would replace the OVS agent in Neutron in the short term.  It would eventually also replace the L3 and DHCP agents once OVN gains the equivalent functionality.</p>

<p><strong>Preserving contaner properties via volume mounts</strong>, by Steven Dake</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the Kolla project, we were heavily using host bind mounts to share filesystem data with different containers.  A host bind mount is an operation where a host directory, such as /var/lib/mysql is mounted directly into the container at some specific location.</p>

<p><strong>Distributed Virtual Routing – Overview and East/West Routing</strong>, by Assaf Muller</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>DVR aims to isolate the failure domain of the traditional network node and to optimize network traffic by eliminating the centralized L3 agent shown above. It does that by moving most of the routing previously performed on the network node to the compute nodes.</p>

<p><strong>Distributed Virtual Routing – Floating IPs</strong>, by Assaf Muller</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Legacy routers provide floating IPs connectivity by performing 1:1 NAT between the VM’s fixed IP and its floating IP inside the router namespace. Additionally, the L3 agent throws out a gratuitous ARP when it configures the floating IP on the router’s external device. This is done to advertise to the external network that the floating IP is reachable via the router’s external device’s MAC address. Floating IPs are configured as /32 prefixes on the router’s external device and so the router answers any ARP requests for these addresses. Legacy routers are of course scheduled only on a select subgroup of nodes known as network nodes.</p>

<p>[A guest post by Victoria Martínez de la Cruz]</p>

<p>OpenStack Trove, included in the latest RDO releases, allows users to use the features of relational and non-relational databases without the added complexity of handling administrative tasks. With Trove, database users don't need to be database experts to provision and manage multiple databases instances.</p>

<p>Apart from the installation and configuration of the different modules you require to use Trove, you will need to build an image specific to the OS and storage backend of your choice.</p>

<p>Currently, there is no easy way to build these images: you can either inject the required files manually or you can use an utility called diskimage-builder.</p>

<p>In this guide we are going to explain how to build a RHEL-based Trove compatible images using a script that wraps diskimage-builder and adds all the required bits.</p>

<p>Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 7 is the minimum recommended version, or the equivalent version of one of the RHEL-based Linux distributions such as CentOS 7, or Fedora 21 or later, to do this task. Also, we assume you have the latest RDO, and that you have already subscribed to the appropriate repositories.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h1 id="install-trove-image-elements">Install trove-image-elements</h1>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The trove-image-elements repository contains the code necessary to build the images with the supported storage backends – currently MySQL and MongoDB. Install git and clone it in your environment using the following directives:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ sudo yum -y install git
$ sudo git clone https://github.com/vkmc/trove-image-elements</p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h1 id="download-a-rhel-based-guest-image">Download a RHEL-based guest image</h1>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Get a base guest image for the distro of your choice. You can get RHEL 7, CentOS 7 and Fedora 21 guest images in https://rdoproject.org/Image_resources. You can also get images for RHEL 6, CentOS 6 or Fedora 20, but the image creation process has not been tested with those versions.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h1 id="create-the-image">Create the image</h1>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>The diskimage-builder tool works by taking a disk image, installing pieces of software - called 'elements' - and repacking it for use.</p>

<p>Running the script will generate a (a great deal of) log output, as the utility opens your base image, registers it to RHSM (in the case of RHEL), updates the system image, installs trove-guestagent and the storage backend of your choice, and packages the image for use in Trove. At the end, you'll have a file named <code>DISTRO-DATASTORE-guest-image.qcow2</code>, where DISTRO and DATASTORE are the GNU/Linux distribution and storage backend you selected.</p>

<h2 id="create-a-rhel7-image">3.1 Create a RHEL7 image</h2>

<p>Run create_trove_image.sh with the following parameters to create a RHEL 7 image with MySQL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ sudo ./create_trove_image.sh –distro rhel –datastore mysql –local-image &lt;path-to-local-image&gt; –rh-user <your-rh-user> --rh-password &lt;your-rh-password&gt; --rh-pool-id &lt;subscription-pool-id&gt;</your-rh-user></p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ sudo ./create_trove_image.sh -d rhel -s mysql -i &lt;path-to-local-image&gt; -u &lt;your-rh-user&gt; -p &lt;your-rh-password&gt; -o <subscription-pool-id></subscription-pool-id></p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="create-a-centos-7-image">3.2 Create a CentOS 7 image</h2>

<p>Run create_trove_image.sh with the following parameters to create a CentOS 7 image with MySQL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ sudo ./create_trove_image.sh –distro centos –datastore mysql –local-image &lt;path-to-local-image&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ sudo ./create_trove_image.sh -d centos -s mysql -i &lt;path-to-local-image&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="create-a-fedora-21-image">3.3 Create a Fedora 21 image</h2>

<p>Run create_trove_image.sh with the following parameters to create a Fedora 21 image with MySQL:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ sudo ./create_trove_image.sh –distro fedora –datastore mysql –local-image &lt;path-to-local-image&gt;</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ sudo ./create_trove_image.sh -d fedora -s mysql -i <path-to-local-image></path-to-local-image></p>
</blockquote>

<ol>
  <li>
    <h1 id="register-the-image-with-trove">Register the Image with Trove</h1>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>First, upload the image to Glance, using either the UI or the API. In the
UI, you can find this in your project's interface at Compute/Images.</p>

<p>Second, register this image with Trove. There is no way to do this from the UI yet, so
you have to do this using the API. For this, we provide a second script load_trove_image.sh.</p>

<p>Simply run load_image_trove.sh specifying the datastore, the datastore version, the packages
required by the image you want to upload and the image id generated by Glance.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ sudo ./load_trove_image.sh –datastore mysql –datastore-version centos-mysql5.5 –packages mysql-server=5.5 –id bbd73560-58aa-4377-b961-3d12e76b0bed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>or</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>$ sudo ./load_trove_image.sh -s mysql -v centos-mysql5.5 -p mysql-server=5.5 -i bbd73560-58aa-4377-b961-3d12e76b0bed</p>
</blockquote>

<p>You are now ready to begin using Trove: launch a new instance using the image you just created and start creating your DBs.</p>
