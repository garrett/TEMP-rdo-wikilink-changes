    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;With the Mitaka milestone 2 release due &lt;a href="http://docs.openstack.org/releases/schedules/mitaka.html"&gt;very soon&lt;/a&gt;, the RDO community
has two events in the coming days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 20th/21st, we'll be focusing on improving the website and
documentation, to make it easier for people to get started with
OpenStack on CentOS. We'll be gathering on #rdo (on Freenode IRC) for
any associated questions/discussion, and working through the &lt;a href="https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues"&gt;open issues
list&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On January 27th/28th, we'll be running a test day of the Mitaka
milestone 2 packages. Details of that test day will be &lt;a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/"&gt;on the test days page&lt;/a&gt; in the coming days, along with
suggested test scenarios that we'd like to run through. Once again,
we'll be gathering on #rdo for this event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We look forward to expanding the audience of these test days, and
thereby improve everyone's CentOS OpenStack experience. So please set
aside an hour or two to help us test. Thanks.&lt;/p&gt;
