DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Andreas Färber\n\nAnthony Liguori has contributed the 
 QEMU Object Model (QOM) as new infrastructure for device modeling and inspe
 ction at the beginning of this year. Highlight some of the changes for devi
 ce authors this requires and provide an outlook of what new possibilities t
 his offers over former qdev. Focus of this talk will be my ongoing CPU remo
 deling - vision\, achievements for v1.1 and v1.2\, next goals.\n\nI assume 
 that Anthony will say some words about QOM in his key note. This presentati
 on will not cover the why/how but rather the how-to and where-to for device
  authors in the status quo as well as some DOs and DON'Ts concerning CPU*St
 ate for all contributors. Depending on upstream progress this talk might al
 so cover a brief overview of differences between softmmu and linux-user wrt
  CPU. I don't plan to go into x86 CPU hotplug details\, that could well be 
 covered by Igor/Eduardo in a separate talk.\n\nFor more information\, inclu

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Mark McLoughlin\n\nHaving recently passes its second b
 irthday\, OpenStack is a relatively new entrant into the world of open-sour
 ce virtualization. Since its announcement\, it has gained incredible tracti
 on and momentum with hundreds of developers contributing to each release. O
 penStack's success * and the potential for it to be deployed pervasively at
  massive scale\, particularly in public clouds - presents an opportunity fo
 r KVM's continued growth and adoption.\n\nMark\, a former KVM developer\, w
 ill introduce the OpenStack project\, its architecture and current status. 
 Mark will then talk in some detail about how OpenStack currently uses KVM a
 nd libvirt before setting the scene for a a discussion about how OpenStack 
 could adopt more of KVM's unique features to the benefit of both projects.\

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Theron Conrey\n\nConverged infrastructure is an idea f
 or virtualization infrastructure that is enabling organizations to deploy m
 ore rapidly on a single commodity hardware platform for both compute and st
 orage infrastructure. Until recently this was something that was difficult 
 to do with Open Source software. This presentation provides an overview of 
 what a converged infrastructure solution looks like and then digs into the 
 Open Source software that can be used to build successful converged solutio
 ns. With Gluster and oVirt as foundational software packages the presentati
 on will dig into advanced scenarios for deploying virtual machines as well 
 as adding additional nodes for both storage and compute. OpenStack networki
 ng\, image management\, and object store will be tied in as well to demonst
 rate the advantages of using Open Source to solve your organization's virtu
 alization challenges.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Gordon Haff\n\nAs an industry\, we’ve mostly moved on 
 from naive notions about cloud computing being inherently “safe” or “risky.
 ” However\, more sophisticated discussions require both greater nuance and 
 greater rigor. This presentation takes attendees through frameworks for eva
 luating and mitigating potential issues in hybrid cloud environments\, disc
 usses key risk factors to consider\, and describes some of the relevant sta
 ndards and provider certifications. This is a broad and sometimes complex t
 opic. However\, it’s very manageable if individual risk factors are conside
 red systematically and specifically. This session will give IT professional
 s tools and knowledge to help them make informed decisions.

 unity members to 10s of millions? Many large software ecosystems that have 
 thrived recently have been powered by developers. So far\, enterprise devel
 opers have remained largely in the periphery as far as OpenStack is concern
 ed although there are serveral use cases like SDLC\, Big Data\, PaaS atop O
 penStack\, Hybrid cloud development\, etc. that is aimed squarely at develo
 pers. Perhaps\, IaaS will never be interesting to developers? Can some of t
 he newer initiatives (like Heat) change this?\n\nAttend this panel to hear 
 different perspectives of should OpenStack appeal to enterprise developers 
 and if so how. Please be armed with the tough questions and opinions of wha
 t does OpenStack mean to enterprise developers. These stackers have worked 
 with large ecosystem of developers in their past lives and represent differ
 ent parts of the OpenStack ecosystem. More than anything they are not hesit
 ant to speak their mind and so should you.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: John Mark Walker\, Eric Harney\n\nThe Gluster communit
 y has been working hard to ensure GlusterFS is integrated with each OpenSta
 ck storage interface. With that integration\, as well as the latest VM imag
 e management features\, GlusterFS 3.4 is now a first-class citizen of the O
 penStack ecosystem.\n\nIn this workshop\, Eric Harney and John Mark Walker 
 will demonstrate how to deploy OpenStack with GlusterFS as a scale-out stor
 age platform today. They will also detail the four major areas of focus for
  integration:\n\nSwift: A GlusterFS-backed storage platform has been implem
 ented for the Swift API using the upstream Swift proxy server/API layer. Th
 is provides a unified storage backend for object as well as POSIX data.\n\n
 Glance: While it has been possible to use a mounted GlusterFS volume as the
  backend data store for Glance for some time\, recent development work has 
 enabled an integrated deployment with Cinder\, significantly increasing the
  performance for deploying VM images on GlusterFS volumes.\n\nCinder: A Cin
 der integration for the Grizzly release added an option for deploying live 
 VM images on GlusterFS volumes. With recent contributions to the Havana rel
 ease\, you can now utilize the QEMU - libgfapi integration that was release
 d in GlusterFS 3.4\, greatly improving the performance of VM image manageme
 nt on GlusterFS.\n\nLibgfapi: With the release of GlusterFS 3.4\, the libgf
 api client library is now the standard way to integrate applications with G
 lusterFS.\n\nFollowing simple examples\, Eric and John Mark will demonstrat
 e:\n\nHow to deploy a GlusterFS-backed object storage solution\, referencin
 g when and why you should use this solution in conjunction with or in lieu 
 of the Swift object storage implementation\n\nHow to access the same data v
 ia NFS\, libgfapi\, the GlusterFS client\, and the Swift API\n\nThe power a
 nd flexibility of Libgfapi\n\nIn addition\, they will provide a brief Glust
 erFS roadmap tour\, discussing upcoming enhancements that will benefit Open

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Flavio Percoco (Panel)\n\nCome to this session to get 
 an update on Marconi\, an OpenStack queuing and notification service descri
 bed at wiki.openstack.org/marconi\n\nMarconi aims to be pragmatic\, buildin
 g upon the real-world experiences of teams who have solid track records run
 ning and supporting web-scale message queuing systems. Users can customize 
 Marconi to achieve a wide range of performance\, durability\, availability\
 , and efficiency goals.\n\nAs a message bus\, Marconi allows cloud develope
 rs to use a REST API to easily distribute tasks to multiple workers across 
 the components of an OpenStack deployment. Publish-subscribe semantics are 
 also supported\, allowing notifications to be distributed to multiple liste
 ners at once.\n\nJoin Rackspace's Kurt Griffiths\, Principal Architect\, an
 d Allan Metts\, Engineering Director\, to learn about the work that has bee
 n done and the path ahead – including a description of the project\, real-w
 orld performance metrics\, and a live demo.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Bob Kukura (Panel)\n\nThis presentation introduces the
  Havana release's new Modular Layer 2 (ML2) plugin for OpenStack Neutron. T
 he ML2 plugin is a community-driven framework allowing OpenStack Neutron to
  simultaneously utilize the variety of layer 2 networking technologies foun
 d in complex\, real-world data centers. ML2 currently works with the Open v
 Switch\, Linux Bridge\, and Hyper-V L2 agents\, and is intended to replace 
 and deprecate those agents' monolithic plugins. The ML2 plugin also works w
 ith SDN controllers and network hardware devices\, and is designed to great
 ly simplify adding support for new L2 networking technologies into OpenStac
 k Neutron.\n\nIn this session\, Cisco and Red Hat representatives will:\n\n
  Introduce the Modular Layer 2 (ML2) plugin for OpenStack Neutron Provide a
 n overview of ML2\, discussing its design principles and detailing use case
  examples Describe ML2's architecture and its driver APIs Demonstrate an Op
 enStack deployment with ML2 utilizing multiple segmentation methods and mul
 tiple L2 networking mechanisms to show the power of the ML2 plugin\n\n Atte
 ndees will leave this session with an understanding of ML2\, the use cases 
 it was designed to solve\, how to deploy ML2 in an OpenStack Havana environ
 ment\, and how existing Neutron deployments can migrate to ML2.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Dave Neary\n\nEarlier this year\, Dave Neary presented
  the theory of personas to attendees of the OpenStack Summit in Portland. A
 ttendees were excited about creating a set of personas for the OpenStack pr
 oject\, as they allow you to have a much clearer idea of your target audien
 ce\, what their needs are\, and how you can reach them. They also allow muc
 h easier communication around feature discussions\, user interface design a
 nd marketing strategy.\n\nBased on data from the user committee survey and 
 user interviews\, a personas working group is being created to answer the q
 uestion: “Who uses OpenStack?” In this session Dave will return to present 
 an initial set of OpenStack personas\, discuss how they were created\, and 
 detail what conclusions we can draw from them.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Diane Mueller\, Krishna Raman\n\nJust getting a cloud 
 environment up and running is no longer enough. The challenge that OpenStac
 k faces is how to get people\, applications and services working on OpenSta
 ck out of the box and to ensure that the “unboxing” experience is as seamle
 ss and painless as possible. Organizations expectations for deploying cloud
  now include being able to rapidly make services and applications available
  as soon as they have IaaS deployed.\n\nTo meet the expectations of most or
 ganizations\, adding a PaaS layer has become an essential part of every Clo
 ud deployment strategy. The OpenShift Origin PaaS project is backed by the 
 fastest growing open-source community of developers\, cloud architects\, de
 vops\, and end users intent on creating the next generation of PaaS and ens
 uring that the tools for deploying\, managing & scaling it for OpenStack ar
 e freely available. To do this on OpenStack\, the OpenShift community has “
 adopted” Heat\, OpenStack's orchestration engine\, and delivered a set of H
 eat templates for deploying\, managing and auto-scaling OpenShift on any Op
 enStack distribution.\n\nThis talk provides an overview of OpenShift\, RedH
 at's Platform as a Service and a deep dive into deploying OpenShift using H
 eat\, OpenStack's template language\, and a live demonstration of Heat tech
 nologies to deploy AND autoscale OpenShift using repeatable orchestration t
 emplates.\n\nWe will demonstrate the power of Heat\, OpenStack's orchestrat
 ion engine and how we leverage Heat to orchestrate cloud infrastructure res
 ources such as storage\, networking\, and instances to deploy OpenShift int
 o a repeatable running environment for OpenStack IaaS platforms.\n\nOpenSta
 ck Summit attendees can learn about both the OpenShift Origin Project\, and
  the emerging Heat template technologies and its impact on Linux and open s
 ource cloud communities.\n\nThe speakers are both experienced with live dem
 onstrations\, and make the technical difficulty of this topic easily approa
 chable through real-life examples.

 in "The Inmates are Running the Asylum\," a seminal book on user interface 
 design for computer programmers. They have been used for decades in the mar
 keting industry\, in user experience design\, and in product planning to he
 lp target specific market segments with features\, ads\, and product design
 .\n\nPersonas help you frame feature discussions while developing your soft

 u to have a more popular\, better project. As the OpenStack project evolves
  beyond its original base and seeks to engage with a broader user community
 \, understanding the profile of OpenStack users becomes critical in increas
 ing participation and thus improving the project.\n\nThis session will cove
 r the basics of: * What is a persona and why should I care? * How do I come
  up with persona(s) for my project? * What can I do with personas?\n\nThis 
 session will be useful to those interested in better understanding their ta
 rget audiences\, and specifically those seeking to grow a community around 
 an open source project.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Dianne Mueller\n\nRedHat has created it's own OpenStac
 k distribution that is now in preview and still a bit rough around the edge
 s\, but promises to include what is needed to deploy & evaluate a truly & c
 omplete Open Cloud environment. In addition\, Red Hat wants there to be a w
 idely used open-source community developed PaaS model for the cloud which i
 ncludes being open to participation by a community of peers.\n\nTo really c
 reate a open cloud environment and to make it useful\, you need to complete
  the stack with an PaaS. Just getting a cloud environment up and running is
  no longer enough. The challenge that OpenStack faces is how to get people\
 , applications and services working on OpenStack out of the box.\n\nOne app
 roach to the problem is to combining all the necessary pieces that go into 
 building an OpenStack cloud (compute\, storage\, networking\, management) w
 ith a platform as a service (PaaS) into your OpenStack distribution.\n\nOpe
 nShift Origin project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0\, a permissi
 ve and widely-used open source license\, which was selected so that the cod
 e would be available for use by the broadest range of\n\nindividuals and or
 ganizations. This is the same license chosen by the OpenStack project\, for
  much the same reason. This license is already well known and understood by
  individuals and organizations already involved in cloud computing and in e
 nterprise scale open source development.\n\nIn this session\, I'll discuss 
 RedHat's efforts with OpenStack\, Fedora\, & OpenShift Origin to create a m
 ore complete OpenStack distribution. Our community initiatives to ensure Or
 igin easily and seamlessly integrates on any OpenStack distribution and how
  to you can add Origin into your own OpenStack distributions.

  PaaS goes beyond developers and beyond dev/test. Efficient application mul
 ti-tenancy and auto-scaling are also key features for production environmen
 ts. Furthermore\, PaaS also means that platform changes can happen without 
 affecting developers\, a big win for architects and procurement officers. I
 n short\, PaaS is for everyone. This session will help attendees understand
  how the PaaS landscape is evolving to provide solutions with appeal across
  many facets of the IT organization and beyond. It will touch on key techni
 cal enablers that are making this possible but will focus predominantly on 
 how organizations are using PaaS today and the benefits that they are seein

  Mark will go on to explain how you should aim to build on OpenStack's arch
 itecture so that operating an OpenStack cloud is as automated as operating 
 a modern cloud based application.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Tomas Sedovic\n\nDeploying complex systems on OpenStac
 k can be a challenge.\n\nA small website running MediaWiki can happily fit 
 on a single server\, but the same software running at the Wikipedia scale i
 s much more demanding. You need to deal with multiple database servers\, we
 b servers\, load balancers\, failover\, networking configuration\, IP addre
 ss assignment and more.\n\nThe Heat project allows you to describe all the 
 resources and their relationships in a single template\, launch everything 
 with one command and keep it up. You can easily combine the workflow with e
 xisting configuration management tools such as Puppet or Chef.\n\nInitially
  modeled after Amazon CloudFormation\, Heat is a free and open source compo
 nent for OpenStack and has recently been accepted into OpenStack incubation
 .\n\nThis session will provide an overview of Heat's capabilities and how t
 o use them\, followed by a live demonstration. At the end you will understa
 nd Heat well enough to decide whether it is useful in your environment and 
 how to get started with it.

 started with a focus on metering (for billing) and has since been extended 
 to other targets such as monitoring and alerting. This project is a collabo
 ration of a wide variety of actors.\n\nAfter a brief introduction of the pr

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Assaf Muller\n\nJoin me for an architectural\, develop
 er oriented overview of (GRE and VXLAN) tunnels in OpenStack Networking.\n\
 nIn the virtualization environment virtual machines are hosted on hyperviso
 rs. These VMs then obtain network connectivity via software switches run in
  the same hypervisors. Data centers that provide infrastructure as a servic
 e have (hopefully) multiple customers (Or 'tenants'). As you can imagine we
  don't want tenants' VMs interacting with one another.\n\nVLANs are a natur
 al approach to achieve tenant segregation. However\, how do we maintain sca
 lability with a growing number of hypervisors and VMs\, when the administra
 tor has to constantly configure the hardware switches manually? Is there an
 other way?\n\nWe all use VPNs to connect to our office resources remotely\,
  or to connect two office sites into one seamless network. VPNs are essenti
 ally encrypted tunnels\, but what are tunnels?\n\nTunnels allow us to wrap 
 packets inside more packets. In our context - VM traffic in exterior IP pac
 kets. That way\, to the intermediate networking hardware\, it looks like tr
 affic between the hypervisors. Since the hypervisors should already be able
  to talk to each other\, this makes VM connectivity a breeze!\n\nLet's expl
 ore how tunnels are used in the cloud as a means to achieve an overlay netw
 ork. What is an overlay network? How does traffic flow between virtual mach
 ines on the same hypervisor\, and on different hypervisors? What are the si
 milarities between a layer 2 learning switch and tunnel logic in OpenStack?
  How does Open vSwitch fit in? Is there a cost to using tunnels?\n\nThis ta
 lk will be useful to developers interested in learning about new networking
  concepts - Minimal background knowledge will be assumed.

 emand Hadoop task execution (Elastic Data Processing). In this talk\, we wi
 ll provide an overview of project Savanna\, its main goals and focus\, and 
 a tour of new features introduced in the Icehouse cycle. These features inc
 lude: integration with Heat\, basic API tests in Tempest\, enabled asynchro
 nous gate\, and bunch of new Elastic Data Processing (EDP) features. We’ll

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Stephen Gordon\n\nAs a cloud deployment grows both in 
 size and in variety of workloads it is useful to be able to segregate compu
 te resources based on factors such as physical location\, networking connec
 tions\, or the availability of specialized hardware. OpenStack provides a n
 umber of options for segregating compute resources in the cloud including: 
 - Cells\, - Host Aggregates\, - Regions\, and - Availability Zones. The dif
 ferences between each of these approaches are nuanced and often misundersto
 od. Additionally the capabilities available when using some of these techni
 ques\, particularly Host Aggregates and Cells\, have been expanded in recen
 t OpenStack releases. This session will provide an indepth look into these 
 each of these options for segregating resources in the OpenStack cloud incl
 uding their pros and cons\, example use cases\, and performance considerati
 ons.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Mark McLoughlin and Monty Taylor\n\nLike many open-sou
 rce projects\, OpenStack uses a time-based release model. Feature developme
 nt happens in a flurry of activity in the first part of each release cycle 
 and then we taper\, allowing enough time for many eyes to make shallow bugs
 " and for us to gain enough confidence in the quality of our release candid
 ates. Even after a release\, we continue to maintain a stable branch for is
 sues found and fixed post-release.\n\nLinux distros apply a similar model w
 hen they bring together the releases of many open-source projects into a co
 herent\, usable and stable product. OpenStack's predictable release schedul
 e\, the tapering\, the stabilization and the post-release maintenance are a
 ll essential to the needs of distros and\, in turn\, the users of those dis
 tros.\n\nUnusually\, OpenStack also explicitly caters to another type of us
 ers - what we call "trunk chasers". Public cloud providers like HP and Rack
 space invest significantly in a continuous delivery pipeline so that they c
 an keep pace with OpenStack development\, deploy regularly\, give timely fe
 edback upstream and minimize the risk associated with each incremental upda
 te. In these days of agile development\, DevOps and continuous delivery\, t
 he benefits of such a model are now clear.\n\nAs such\, OpenStack is an imp
 ortant case study for how recent thinking around continuous delivery is inf
 luencing open-source projects. Many questions remain unanswered\, however. 
 Are we going to continue to see projects like OpenStack see themselves as c
 atering to two radically different audiences\, or is this the beginning of 
 fundamental shift in open-source?\n\nMark and Monty - Openstack Technical C
 ommittee and Foundation Board members\, prominent OpenStack contributors an
 d senior engineering leaders at Red Hat and HP - have had the opportunity t
 o look at this dilemma from several different angles. In the talk\, they wi
 ll delve into some of the details behind how OpenStack caters to both model
 s. They will examine the mindset and needs of each audience. They will talk
  about topics such as CI\, upgrades\, deployment tools\, reference architec
 tures\, community management\, feature development\, user feedback and more
 .\n\nAttendees can hope to learn some more about OpenStack and some of the 
 challenges in running an open-source project\, building a distro or maintai
 ning a public cloud. Beyond OpenStack\, however\, the talk should provide s
 ome more general food for thought around the agile development methodologie
 s used by many application developers today versus the methodologies used b
 y open-source projects today.

 \, and you have a pretty good idea of what that means\, but what's OpenStac
 k? In this talk\, you'll get the high-level view of what OpenStack is\, wha
 t all the moving parts do\, and how they fit together. We'll also talk abou
 t the OpenStack Foundation\, and how the project is governed.\n\nTopics cov
 ered will include:\n\n The various parts of the stack How they communicate 
 with one another How to spin up an OpenStack private cloud How the OpenStac
 k Foundation operates\, and a brief history of the project How to get invol

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Brian Proffitt\n\nThe difference between the scale up 
 model used in virtual datacenter management tools like oVirt and vSphere an
 d the cloud's scale out model used in OpenStack and CloudStack has historia
 lly used the pets versus cattle model. But what if there was another way to
  describe how virtual machines are handled in the datacenter or the cloud? 
 In this pop-culture talk\, Brian Proffitt will expain these concepts and pr
 esent the idea that it's the starships of Starfleet and the fighters of the
  Empire and the Alliance that can better demonstrate the complexities of vi
 rtual machine management. Datacenter VMs that scale up are more in line wit
 h the starships of Starfleet: large\, dedicated ships that have an intense 
 amount of investment\, not just in the ships themselves\, but in the crews 
 that man them. These ships are multifunctional\, dedicated to exploration\,
  defense\, and intergalactic troubleshooting. Laden with science labs\, wea
 ponry\, and very diverse crews\, these ships are designed to function auton
 omously in a a variety of situations. Compare that with the ships of the Em
 pire or the Alliance. Single-purpose ships with a seemingly lower investmen
 t in crews. On the Empire side\, there is very little diversity\, with ship
 s and weaponry all designed for singular purposes. Empire crews are literal
 ly cut from the same cloth\, and there is very little autonomy on any scale
 . The Alliance is slightly better\, but their ships seems aligned to counte
 r the Empire model\, and so fall into the same "disposable" model. Crew div
 ersity is infinitely better\, but the barrier to entry seems a little low (
 "let's give the kid from the sticks an X-Wing fighter with no formal traini
 ng!"). In many respects\, these fictional universes represent how VMs are t
 reated in the datacenter and the cloud. This talk will take a light-hearted
  and totally geeked-out approach to discussing VMs in modern IT environment
 s.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Eoghan Glynn\n\nOn February 9th\, at 14:00 UTC\, Eogha

  Kilo release of OpenStack.\n\nIt will be [streamed live on YouTube](https:
 //plus.google.com/events/cht3k5nr5u73pv3d08i7vq5m570)\, and will also be av
 ailable at that location afterwards.\n\nKilo milestone 2 is due on February
  5\, so this is traditionally around the time that mid-cycle meetings happe
 n to evaluate the status of projects\, and set expectations for what will a
 ctually make it into the release. So I hope that we'll be able to schedule 
 more of these hangouts in time between Milestone 2 and the release on April
  30th. (See the [Kilo release schedule](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Kil

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Steve Baker\n\nImage-based deployment of cloud applica
 tions is becoming a reality thanks to the growing popularity of Docker\; ho
 wever image-based deployments bring new challenges when it comes to orchest
 rating and managing the life-cycle of complex container-based applications.
  Heat is an orchestration service that can be offered by an OpenStack cloud
 . Steve will demonstrate how Heat is an ideal solution to orchestrate image
 -based applications\, whether they are packaged as Docker images or full go
 lden images. Image-building tools\, such as diskimage-builder\, will also b
 e presented\, along with options for how to manage images in the OpenStack 
 or Docker registries. This presentation is focused on Heat\, but is aimed a
 t anyone who deploys applications to the cloud\, regardless of whether they
  use Heat\, OpenStack\, or Docker.\n\nSee the linuxconf.au [schedule](http:
 //linux.conf.au/schedule/30047/view_talk?day=thursday) for details.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Chmouel Boudjnah\n\nOn one side you have the kid that 
 used to be that everybody was talking about\, and on the other side the new
  fancy kid that everybody is talking about. OpenStack is an Infrastructure 
 as a service OpenSource project that have seen a really large support and a
 doption from users and large companies. Docker is a easy API and tools to m
 ake Linux containers super easy to manage and change the way you are lookin
 g at your deployment to be more focus on the application. For a bit of time
  the two was contemplating how their workflow could fits with questions lik
 e "is a container a VM or can a VM considered a container?". Things now are
  well defined and most OpenStack components have been updated to support Do
 cker. In this session we are going what are the use cases between Docker an
 d OpenStack\, how they can live happily in your infrastructure\, and what a
 re the ways to make it even better in the future.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Flavio Percoco\n\nWe've been talking about Infrastruct
 ure providers for quite a bit already. OpenStack itself started as such an 
 IaaS and then it quickly became a cloud provider. But what does that mean? 
 What is a cloud provider suppose to provide? What's cloud after all?\n\nSca
 ling a distributed system goes beyond virtualization\, shared storage etc. 
 In order to support on-demand scaling it is necessary to have an easy way t
 o provision and consume the available infrastructure\, a way for the servic
 es running in it to communicate\, etc. Not to mention latency needs\, relia
 bility\, etc.\n\nThis talk aims to answer the above questions and take a st
 ep further down the path of explaining what should be considered essential 
 for nowadays needs\, especially when those needs require a cloud to be cove
 red.

 enarios. With multiple layers of software between the user and the virtual 
 machine\, how does one troubleshoot failures and performance issues?\n\nThi
 s presentation covers tools and techniques for observing virtual machines w
 ith the KVM hypervisor. It gives you a mental model of KVM's architecture s
 o you'll know how to get to the bottom of questions about virtual machine b
 ehavior and performance.\n\nAreas covered include guest CPU activity\, RAM\
 , disk I/O\, network traffic\, and the QEMU monitor. Examples are based on 
 real-life scenarios often encountered by KVM users.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Steven Ellis\n\nDo you need to utilise many different 
 public cloud technologies\, or perhaps you’d like to put a cloud friendly s
 hine on that rust old legacy VMware infrastructure. Perhaps the learning cu
 rve for OpenStack is too steep or it is missing critical feature you requir
 e? Take a look at ManageIQ\, an Open Source project that can broker across 
 on-premise IaaS as well as Public/Private cloud environments to provide a o
 ne stop shop for your DevOps needs. This session will cover the key feature
 s of ManageIQ and demo connectivity to a range of Cloud and IaaS technologi
 es.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Mark McLoughlin\, Alexis Monville\n\nMark is a long-ti
 me open-source practitioner and advocate. Alexis is a long-time Agile pract
 itioner and advocate. In recent times\, they find each other working very c
 losely together\, searching for ways to help Red Hat’s OpenStack team conti
 nuously improve its way of working.\n\nMark will spend some time describing
  his view of the key abstract ideas and principles that should influence th
 e thinking of those leading\, or contributing to\, open-source projects. Al
 exis will spend a similar amount of time talking about the abstract ideas a
 nd principles from the Agile\, DevOps\, Continuous Delivery\, and Lean move
 ments that every software project should draw from.\n\nTogether they will d
 raw some conclusions relevant to the OpenStack community in general\, but p
 articularly relevant to those who wish to both contribute to and build upon
  OpenStack. They expect this will contribute to an ongoing conversation to 
 improve the way individuals and companies are contributing to the success o
 f OpenStack.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Thomas Cameron\n\nApplication containerization is one 
 of the coolest technologies in IT. It solves numerous problems\, allows for
  incredible application density\, and can really increase flexibility and r
 esponsiveness. But not everyone understands what makes up container securit
 y - it's a LOT more than what application is in the container.\n\nIn this s
 ession\, Red Hat’s global solution architect leader\, Thomas Cameron\, will
  talk about the basic components of container security. He'll talk about ke
 rnel namespaces\, Security Enhanced Linux\, Linux control groups\, the Dock
 er daemon\, etc. and how they all work. He'll provide demonstrations of how
  each of these technologies affect security.\n\nHe'll also talk about tips 
 and tricks for planning a secure container environment\, describe some “got
 chas” about containers\, and debunk some of the security myths about contai
 ners.\n\nAttendees will understand the fundamentals of container security w
 hen they leave.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Dave Neary\n\nNetworks Functions Virtualizationm or NF
 V\, is a very hot industry topic at the moment. What you might not know is 
 what it means - telecommunications companies who have traditionally used on
 ly proprietary software to run their core services are now embracing free a
 nd open source software\, and in the process changing the way they build an
 d deploy core telco serives to be more open.\n\nThis presentation will revi
 ew what makes up an NFV stack in OPNFV\, covering OpenStack\, OpenDaylight\
 , Open vSwitch\, DPDK\, QEMU\, the Linux kernel\, and other projects. I wil
 l present the work being done in these communities to enable the migration 
 of telco applications to this platform\, particularly in the areas of impro
 ved network dataplane performance\, enabling better management of applicati
 ons running on the platform\, and the ability to run real-time guest worklo
 ads with KVM.\n\nI will also look at the organisational transformation in t
 he telecommunications industry\, and the adoption of DevOps and agile pract
 ices\, and the evolving culture of the telecommunications industry\, and ho
 w the changes that are happening at the request of the telecommunications i
 ndustry benefit everyone\, from the home hardware hacker hobbyist to IT ope
 rations in small and large companies.

  you really need? How important is processor speed? What else do I need to 
 know?\n\nUsing RDO-manager\, get a basic cloud up and running with the fewe
 st steps and minimal hardware so you can focus on the fun stuff - developme
 nt!\n\nAfter this presentation\, you will be able to build your own basic c

 by GNU Guix\, a functional package manager\, in order to improve tox. We wi
 ll give real-life examples using Python packages from the OpenStack project
 .

 ed on modern knowledge on compilers and GPU architecture. The Intel i965 dr
 iver is fully powered by NIR now\, after support to non-scalar shaders has 
 been recently added.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Maor Lipchuk\n\nThe demand for managing a large amount
  of data in a scalable yet reliable and cost-effective way has became more 
 and more relevant in this day and age. Ceph\, a software-defined storage\, 
 provides an original solution for this problem and guarantees a resilient a
 nd self-healing way for managing large amount of data up to the Exabyte lev
 el. In this session I will talk about a new feature introduced in oVirt 3.6
  which provides the ability to integrate with Red Hat Ceph storage using Ci
 nder\, a storage service used mainly for OpenStack. This integration reveal
 s new opportunities and tools for storage management in a scalable and virt
 ualized way and also opens the door for interesting future integrations wit
 h other storage providers.

DESCRIPTION:Speaker: Joe Brockmeier\n\nA lot of folks are talking about con

  a number of cases where they're working together. I want to talk about the
  relationship between virtualization and containers\, and some of the effor
 ts to manage virtualization / IaaS technologies with containers to make the
 m easier to deploy and manage. This includes efforts to containerize things
  like oVirt and OpenStack\, as well as the best way to run KVM virtual mach
 ines in privileged containers.
