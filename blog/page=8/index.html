<p>Another edition of the <a href="http://openstack.org/summit">OpenStack Summit</a> is coming up, this time in Tokyo. And, as usual, you have an opportunity to <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers">influence which talks will be selected</a> for the event.</p>

<p>Of course, we're biased, and there's some talks we'd like to draw to your attention, in the hopes that there will be more RDO content at Summit, and we can bring even more people into our community.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/4700"><strong>Dive into Zuul</strong>, with Fabien Boucher</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The OpenStack development workflow is one of the many reasons for the cloud platform’s success, and learning how it works is essential to going farther with the OpenStack project. In this talk, we will highlight features of Zuul, the gating tool that was specifically designed to manage contributions to OpenStack, by giving simple use case examples. This talk can help an OpenStack contributor gain a better understanding of the gating system used for OpenStack and can also be valuable for those wanting to improve their existing Gerrit/Jenkins-based continuous integration (CI) platform.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5083"><strong>Common OpenStack RPM packaging upstream</strong>, with Dirk Müller, Haïkel Guémar, and Thomas Bechtold</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Following a spark of discussion that started back at the last OpenStack Summit in Vancouver, RPM Packagers
from Red Hat and SUSE decided to just try coming up with common RPM packaging that works universally across
their distributions.
Meeting again half a year later we're recapping on how the packaging efforts started and what has been achieved
so far and give an introduction for both new comers and existing Cloud Operators a way to join the effort.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5043"><strong>CentOS loves OpenStack</strong>, with Haïkel Guémar, Rich Bowen, and Thomas Oulevey</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One year ago, CentOS introduced Special Interest Groups (SIGs) which are smaller groups focus on a small set of issues. The Cloud SIG is one focused into bringing Cloud Infrastructure on top of CentOS, and among this group, we aimed to make OpenStack a first-class citizen with CentOS.
OpenStack distribution is not just about packaging but also integration with the underlying Operating System. We learnt a lot from this experience, and managed to make OpenStack fit within CentOS story. Bridging the OpenStack
upstream and the CentOS downstream communities, effectively.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/6324"><strong>TryStack.org: Free OpenStack for Planet Earth</strong>, with Will Foster,  Dan Radez,  Will Gough, Ben Swartzlander, and Kambiz Aghaiepour</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The OpenStack Foundation and several generous corporate sponsors (including Red Hat, Dell, Cisco, and NetApp) have deployed TryStack.org, a free way for folks to learn more about OpenStack and its capabilities. TryStack is a production OpenStack instance, and the maintainers have learned a great deal about deployments, maintenance, upgrades, gotchas, and monitoring.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/4669"><strong>RDO: Continuously packaging OpenStack master</strong>, with Francisco Javier Peña, Haïkel Guémar, and Derek Higgins</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Did you know that, right after the stable Kilo branches were created, you already had access to Liberty packages from the RDO community? RDO is continuously building packages from the master OpenStack branches, fixing them as needed and running integration tests.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/4440"><strong>RDO: How we package the cloudy monster</strong>, with Jakub Ruzicka</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>RDO is an open community dedicated to packaging OpenStack and providing high-quality RPM packages for supported distributions. And, because OpenStack is a huge project with lightning-fast development, there are many challenges in packaging it for slower-moving Linux distributions.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5245"><strong>RDO Manager 101: OpenStack Deployment &amp; Management</strong>, with Guillaume Chenuet and  Alexandre Maumené</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you have deployed OpenStack before, than you know how platforms come with various degrees of complexity and features. As a DevOps, one of our first challenge is to setup a platform, then maintain it through regular bug &amp; security updates, while ensuring there is no downtime for users (because hey, it's in production!).</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5014"><strong>Ambassador community report</strong>, with a large panel of presenters</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenStack Ambassadors connect the user groups to the Foundation. They help initialize the groups and guide them to grow. Ambassadors can give feedback about all the OpenStack community.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5119"><strong>OpenStack OpenSource Cloud Management</strong>, with John Hardy</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>ManageIQ is an Open Source Cloud Management Platform that brings together vendors for best of breed management within a single pane glass view interface. The project supports many vendors as pluggable providers; Open Stack has both Infrastructure and Cloud provider plugins available for ManageIQ.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/4876"><strong>Cache-as-a Service in OpenStack</strong>, with Dan Lambright and Luis Pabón</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Web based applications can see improved response times using distributed object caches.  In this talk, you will learn how such applications can enjoy caching benefits when they move to OpenStack using our implementation of "Cache-as-a-Service". Our design goals have been elasticity, maintainability, transparency to applications, and chargeability to tenants. We will explore several designs we considered and their trade offs, including service VMs and special-purpose instances spun up within the tenant, and show how they can be orchestrated using OpenStack Heat. Our implementation exports memcache and REDIS interfaces.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/presentation/5880"><strong>Leveraging Procedural Knowledge - A Path From n00b to OpenStack Contributor</strong>, with Rain Leander</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On the road to senior developer, one has to learn multiple languages. This often seems like a series of massive obstacles wherein each new language resembles a new beginning. However, developers may often underestimate the extent to which procedural knowledge from one language transfers to a new language. In this talk, I will demonstrate that the process from support engineer to Django Girls workshop participant to OpenStack contributor was a series of procedural knowledge transfers, wherein the obstacles to learning reduces with each new technology that is learned.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/tokyo-2015/vote-for-speakers/Presentation/4094"><strong>Debugging the Virtualization layer (libvirt and QEMU) in OpenStack</strong>, with Kashyap Chamarthy</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Virtualization drivers (e.g. libvirt, QEMU/KVM) are the core part of OpenStack Compute layer. An OpenStack environment is challenging to debug as is – more so when multiple Compute nodes and thereby multiple libvirt daemons and QEMU instances are involved. A good grasp of Virtualization debugging mechanisms is vital for effective root cause analysis. To that end, libvirt and QEMU provide a rich set of debugging controls that allow us to query (or modify) the state of virtual machines in distress.</p>

<p><strong>Containerize OpenStack with Docker</strong> by Ryan Hallisey</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today in the cloud space, a lot of buzz in the market stems from Docker and providing support for launching containers on top of an existing platform. However, what is often overlooked is the use of Docker to improve deployment of the infrastructure platforms themselves; in other words, the ability to ship your cloud in containers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this post we will see how a packet generated by a VM is able to reach another VM or an external resource, what are the key concepts/components in the context of Neutron using the OpenContrail plugin. We will focus on OpenContrail, how it implements the overlay and the tools that it provides to check/troubleshoot how the packet are forwarded. Before getting started, I’ll give a little overview of the key concepts of OpenContrail.</p>

<p><strong>Dive into Zuul – Gated commit system</strong>, by Fabien Boucher</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Zuul is a software developed by the OpenStack community. It was developed as an efficient gated commit system, allowing projects to merge patches only after they pass a series of tests. It reduces the probability of breaking the master branch, for instance when unit tests or functional tests no longer pass on the tip of master.</p>

<p>If you're writing about RDO, or about OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora or RHEL, and you're not on my list, please let me know!</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack’s Volume Backup Status</strong> by Gorka Eguileor</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When working in the Cloud the idea of doing backups like in the old days may seen counter intuitive. After all, the main reasons for having backups are recovering data after it’s lost, by deletion or corruption, and recovering it from an earlier time, and you have those covered with fast volume snapshots and the use of fault tolerant back-ends like Ceph, that replicate data, for your volumes. So, why would you still need old school backups?</p>

<p><strong>A fresh look for the oVirt Administrator Portal Dashboard</strong> by Liz Blanchard</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In the next major release of oVirt, we have been putting some thought into updating the Dashboard for the Administrator Portal. The goal for this update would be to allow admins to quickly glance at the state of their environment, see the metrics that are most important to them, and then jump off to dig even deeper from there.</p>

<p><strong>Heat-kubernetes Demo with Autoscaling</strong> by Lars Kellogg-Stedman</p>

<p><strong>Cinder Volume Back Up Automation</strong> by Gorka Eguileor</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my previous post on OpenStack’s volume backups I gave an overview of Cinder’s Backup service current status and I mentioned that some of the limitations that currently exist could be easily overcome scripting a helper tool. In this post I’m going to explain different options to create such a script and provide one as a sample/reference.</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack Networking without DHCP</strong> by Lars Kellogg-Stedman</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In an OpenStack environment, cloud-init generally fetches information from the metadata service provided by Nova. It also has support for reading this information from a configuration drive, which under OpenStack means a virtual CD-ROM device attached to your instance containing the same information that would normally be available via the metadata service.</p>

<p>Here's what RDO enthusiasts have been writing about over the past week.</p>

<p>If you're writing about RDO, or about OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora or RHEL, and you're not on my list, please let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Survey: OpenStack users value portability, support, and complementary open source tools</strong>
by Gordon Haff</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>75 percent of the respondents in a recent survey conducted for Red Hat said that being able to move OpenStack workloads to different providers or platforms was important (ranked 4 or 5 out of 5)–and a mere 5 percent said that this question was of least importance. This was just one of the answers that highlighted a general desire to avoid proprietary solutions and lock-in.</p>

<p><strong>Streamlining the Install of OpenStack with the RDO Manager UI</strong>, by Liz Blanchard</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Before being able to use everything that OpenStack has to offer, you need to be able to install it. The installation step of OpenStack has been a heavily talked about topic over the last few years. Whether you are a developer or tester trying to get your environment up and running or an end user trying to use OpenStack to spin up VMs, you’ve most likely put a fair amount of time into the install and configuration step. Since it’s the first thing every user experiences with OpenStack we really need to make it as effortless as possible. OpenStack is an interesting beast because there are so many pieces to the project (some being optional) which make configuration very tricky. We’ve set out to reduce the frustration from a user’s point of view as we designed RDO Manager.</p>

<p><strong>RDO and Upstream Packaging</strong> by Mark McLoughlin</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Derek mentioned “upstream packaging” on this week’s packaging meeting and asked RDO packagers to participate in the upstream discussions. I thought some more context might be useful.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Continuing in the series about the RDO Meetup in Vancouver, in this recording we have Karsten Wade, of the CentOS project, talking about CentOS’s relationship with RDO, and with OpenStack in general. He talks about the CentOS build infrastructure, CI, package repos, and the CentOS Cloud SIG.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Policy and Microversions</strong> by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Both Core APIs and Policy have been static for a long part of OpenStack’s lifespan.  While I’ve been working on Dynamic Policy, the Nova team has been looking to use microversions to allow the API to morph more quickly.  Are the two approaches going to interoperate, or are they going to conflict?</p>

<p><strong>Back from Vancouver, towards Liberty</strong>, by Flavio Percoco</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just like in every other summit, we had fun, we discussed things, we brainstormed, we (kinda) fought, we enjoyed the excitement of being there and we came back with plans that we consider are a common ground between what we and others think is best for our projects and our community.</p>

<p><strong>Life at the Intersection of Pets and Cattle</strong>, by Andrew Beekhof</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The theory goes that pets have no place in the server room. Everything should be stateless and replicated and if one copy dies, who cares because there are 100 more. Except real life isn’t like that.</p>

<p><strong>TripleO Liberty Recap</strong>, by James Slagle</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Over the Kilo cycle, we’ve added a bunch of features to TripleO. See my last blog post for more details of what was added. TripleO has been able to deploy OpenStack clouds for a while, but the community has really been focusing on pushing forwards with making the tooling flexible enough to deploy across a wide variety of production needs. We’ve made a lot of great progress recently. At the summit, a couple of clear messages shone through to me concerning TripleO.</p>

<p><strong>Geocaching at OpenStack Summit</strong>, by Rich Bowen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Well, I <em>planned</em> to go geocaching at OpenStack Summit, but it really didn’t work out. Almost every moment that I wasn’t working the expo hall, I was in my hotel room, in bed. Yes, I spent most of OpenStack Summit week sick, and didn’t get out of the hotel much.</p>
