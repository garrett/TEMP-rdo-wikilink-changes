<p>Here's what RDO enthusiasts have been writing about over the past week.</p>

<p>If you're writing about RDO, or about OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora or RHEL, and you're not on my list, please let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Migrating Cinder volumes between OpenStack environments using shared NFS storage</strong> by Lars Kellogg-Stedman</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Many of the upgrade guides for OpenStack focus on in-place upgrades to your OpenStack environment. Some organizations may opt for a less risky (but more hardware intensive) option of setting up a parallel environment, and then migrating data into the new environment. In this article, we look at how to use Cinder backups with a shared NFS volume to facilitate the migration of Cinder volumes between two different OpenStack environments.</p>

<p><strong>So, you're an ATC. Let me tell you something</strong> by Flavio Percoco</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's that time of the cycle - ha! you saw this comming, didn't you? -, in OpenStack, when we need to elect new members for the Technical Committee. In a previous post, I talked about what being a PTL means. I talked directly to candidates and I encouraged them to understand each and every point that I've made in that post. This time, though, I'd like to talk directly to ATCs for a couple of reasons. First one is that Thierry Carrez has a great post already where he explains what being a TC member means. Second one is that I think you, my dear ATC, are one of the most valuable member of this community and of the ones with most power throughout OpenStack.</p>

<p><em>This continues my <a href="/blog/ptl-interviews">series talking with OpenStack project PTLs</a> (Project Technical Leads) about their projects, what's new in Liberty, and what's coming in future releases.</em></p>

</audio>

<p><strong>R</strong>: I'm Rich Bowen, I'm the community liaison for the OpenStack project
at Red Hat. I'm speaking with Haikel Guemar, who is the Project
Technical Lead (PTL) on the <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Rpm-packaging">RPM packaging project</a> at OpenStack. Thanks
for taking this time to speak with me.</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: Thank you, Rich. I appreciate it.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: This is a fairly new project, in terms of actually being part of
OpenStack - is that right?</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: Yeah, exactly. We've been an official project for a few months, and
we're still in bootstrapping. There has been some discussion at the
last Summit to converge packaging project to work together, upstream.
After some discussion we discussion, we decided to split between two
separate projects, one around Debian packaging, and one around RPM
packaging. So we've been working with people from RDO, SUSE, and also
some people from Mirantis, to work together on RPM packaging upstream.</p>

<p>By the way, I'm co-PTL of the project. I'm co-leading the project with
Dirk Mueller from SUSE. Hats off to Dirk, if you're listening to us.
We're trying to bring packaging into the heart of the project, because
OpenStack is fairly good at trying to develop its own software
pipeline, and the only bit that was missing was packaging - the last
missing bit between the project and the end-user.</p>

<p>So, we've been trying to do that, and also help the upstream project
to understand what are our needs upstream, because we have very
specific requirements that we want them to hear.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: How do you picture this project changing the downstream projects like
RDO and Fuel? Do you think there will be a big impact on those, or
will they go on as though nothing's changed?</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: I think there will be some impact, because if all the downstream
packages are working on this, at some point we will be able to produce
multiple packagings. There will still be some differences, but what we
are working on - trying to mitigate them and trying to share most of
our workers.</p>

<p>Speaking now with my RDO hat - I do hope that at some point, RDO will
derive from our upstream RPM packaging. That's what we want to do - be
closer to upstream. That's the point of RDO, not of the upstream
project.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Looking forward to that time, what would then be the role of
projects like RDO, and Fuel. Would they still be relevant, or do you
see them going away long term.</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: Tough question. I think they will still be there, because at some
point we will be targeting very different segments. For instance, RDO
itself is the upstream for other downstream distributions of
OpenStack. Like, obviously, the Red Hat one, or Cisco's, or many
others. I think that maybe RDO might disappear, maybe, but we still
want to have some degree of integration. I hope that most of it will
go upstream, because that's where people are working, and we want to
deal with before it reaches the users, not after we release.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: In Liberty, and even more in future releases, with the integrated
release kind of going away, and more reliance on tags, is the RPM
packaging project going to package everything, or just a particular
tag, or will that be up to the community.</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: That will be up to the community. The core upstream RPM packaging
team will be working on core projects. We will be looking at Big Tent
projects according to our own drive. But if people want to contribute
any other Big Tent projects, they are welcome to do it. We are really
looking forward to extending the comunity. We're still a small team so
we will be focusing on core OpenStack. Currently we're working on
clients because that's what everyone needs to work with OpenStack, and
when we're done, then we'll start working on services.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: One of the things that RDO does is the CI effort within the CentOS
infrastructure. And there's obviously also a lot of that happening in
the upstream OpenStack. Will the RPM packaging rely on the upstream
for this?</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: We had some talks about it, and that was a funny discussion,
because we discovered that our respective CI are more or less the same
steps, and encounter the same issues. So we are willing to push more
of the CI upstream.</p>

<p>I personally hope - but it's not something that we agreed on - I hope
that we will become part of the continuous delivery pipeline of
OpenStack. That means that every commit from upstream would be
packaged and then introduced into the CI, and then these patches would
be usable for other CI, since we don't have any concrete example, I
will take one from RDO. We've been working with Puppet upstream CI
recently, as they wanted to have come CI on CentOS, so we've been
working on fixing staging issues that were affecting their CI so they
could test properly Puppet upstream modules on CentOS. That was
amazing because they helped us find many many issues that we were able to
solve very early. And that's what I hope for the upstream RPM project.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: I noticed that they are no candidates for the PTL for the project
in the coming election. Is that just because the project is so new,
you're not going to have turnover in that?</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: Yeah, that was the discussion just this afternoon about it. We're
still new, and we don't want to confuse people with elections just
now. We're still building the community, and we've been working on
that with Dirk. The project won't be leaderless. It's still difficult
too, because we still have so much to do.</p>

<p>The main difference between the RPM packaging team and other teams is
that we're not solely dedicated to work on upstream tasks, like
Cinder, Glance, or Nova. We have much more downstream-focused teams,
so we wanted to stay focused. So we thought we would just keep the
same PTLs for the next cycle. And then when we are more mature we will
have candidacy.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: As PTL … it's been interesting talking with various projects,
because the role of PTL can vary a great deal depending on the size
and maturity of the project. I was wondering if you could tell us what
your responsibilities are as PTL.</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: Our responsibility is ensuring that all the community team is
aligned around the same goals. It means also trying to gather new
members. For instance, being the PTL brings the attention on you, so
people contact you so they can join the project. As we are still
small, that was a critical path, and I have been trying to have them
join the team, and make them active participants. I've been pretty
happy that, for instance, Mirantis people reached out to me, and
they've been able to join, and I appreciate that. One of the other
things is to ensure that we are working together. I'm pretty happy
that I am co-PTL with Dirk, because we can share the load. It is very
tiring. We have to schedule meetings and gather people. Recently we
had a hack day, to solve some of our impediments. We have to ensure
that we have enough people, and we have the right people, to help. For
instance, we have tooling issues, so I tried to get some people who
would be likely to work on that aspect available for that day. I do
not view the PTL as someone who decides everything. It's more about
being the coordinator.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Finally: if somebody does want to get involved in the project,
where should they come? Is it to the mailing list, or IRC, or what?</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: We're still using the openstack-devel mailing list with 'RPM
Packaging' topics. We have an IRC channel on Freenode, which is
#openstack-rpm-packaging. We have regular meetings every two weeks on
Thursday. We sometimes have an additional meeting, at the same time.
We keep logs of our agenda. And if you need anything else, just ping
<code>number80</code> or <code>dirk</code> on the channel, and we'd be happy to help you.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Thank you again for taking time to speak with me.</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>OpenContrail on the controller side</strong> by Sylvain Afchain</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my previous post I explained how packets are forwarded from point to point within OpenContrail. We saw the tools available to check what are the routes involved in the forwarding. Last time we focused on the agent side but now we are going to understand on another key component: the controller..</p>

<p><strong>Highly available virtual machines in RHEL OpenStack Platform 7</strong> by Steve Gordon</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenStack provides scale and redundancy at the infrastructure layer to provide high availability for applications built for operation in a horizontally scaling cloud computing environment. It has been designed for applications that are “designed for failure” and voluntarily excluded features that would enable traditional enterprise applications, in fear of limiting its’ scalability and corrupting its initial goals. These traditional enterprise applications demand continuous operation, and fast, automatic recovery in the event of an infrastructure level failure. While an increasing number of enterprises look to OpenStack as providing the infrastructure platform for their forward-looking applications they are also looking  to simplify operations by consolidating their legacy application workloads on it as well.</p>

<p><strong>Ossipee</strong> by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenStack is a big distributed system. FreeIPA is designed for security in distributed system. In order to develop and test each of them, separately or together, I need a distributed system. Virtualization has been a key technology for making this kind of work possible. OpenStack is great of managing virtualization. Added to that is the benefits found when one “Fly our own airplanes.” Thus, I am using OpenStack to develop OpenStack.</p>

<p>If you're writing about RDO, or about OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora or RHEL, and you're not on my list, please let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Let me tell you something about being a PTL</strong>, by Flavio Percoco</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It's that time of the cycle, in OpenStack, when projects need to elect who's going to be the PTL for the next 6 months. People look at the, hopefully many, candidacies and vote based on the proposals that are more sound to them. I believe, for the PTL elections, the voting process has worked decently, which is why this post is not meant for voters but for the, hopefully many, PTL candidates.</p>

<p><strong>Big data in the open, private cloud</strong> by Tim Gasper</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Organizations that take advantage of comprehensive insights from their data can gain a competitive edge. However, the ever-increasing amount of data coming in can make it hard to see trends. Adding to this challenge, many companies have data locked in silos, making it difficult—if not impossible—to gain critical insights. Big data technologies like Hadoop can help unify and organize data, but getting fast, meaningful insight still isn’t easy.</p>

<p>At LinuxCon two weeks ago I had the privilege of chatting with Kyle about the future of Neutron. Kyle was a delight to interview, because he's obviously so passionate about his project.</p>

<p>If the audio player below doesn't work for you, you can listen to the interview <a href="http://drbacchus.com/podcasts/openstack/kyle_neutron.mp3">HERE</a>, or see the transcript below</p>

<p>R: This is Rich Bowen. I'm the OpenStack community liaison at Red Hat.  This is a continuation of my series … I'm talking with various Project Technical Leads (PTLs) at OpenStack about what's coming in the future. We've noticed … ever since I've been involved with OpenStack I've noticed that networking is always the number one place where people have difficulties. I'm really excited to be taling with <strong>Kyle Mestery</strong>, who is the PTL of <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron"><strong>Neutron</strong></a>. Thanks so much for taking time to do this.</p>

<p>K: Absolutely, Rich. Thanks a lot. I'm definitely excited to talk about this, because networking is obviously important. You've got to have a network for your compute nodes.</p>

<p>R: We're doing this in person at LinuxCon. My other two interviews were online. So that's what all this background noise is. When I did the other two interviews, I focused mainly on what's new in Kilo and and what's coming in Liberty. But I'm particularly interested in looking a little bit further out with Neutron, because this seems to be a really difficult problem, but just in the last few years we've seen amazing progress here. Tell me what you see coming in Liberty, and in M and N and O and P and …</p>

<p>K: I guess what I'd like to start talking about is maybe a little bit less about the technology, and more about the project itself.</p>

<p>Neutron, if you look at all the metrics, whether it's code reviews, bugs, blueprints, everything … it's in the top four for everything usually. So it's a really large project. And we're also the project that has the most plugins and drivers. So we've kind of had this problem in the history of … we implemented a platform, for networking, an API and a platform layer, but we also have a reference implementation, and then we have this huge grouping of implementations of the API, whether they're from vendors or other Open Source projects, like <a href="https://www.opendaylight.org/">OpenDaylight</a> or <a href="http://www.opencontrail.org/">OpenContrail</a> or something like that.</p>

<p>And there's been this perception problem of, what is Neutron? Is it a platform? Or is it Neutron, the OVS + ML2 implementation? And so I think, over the years, that's been a concern. People who had issues with Neutron, maybe had issues with this OVS + ML2 implementation.</p>

<p>What we've done over the last year - Juno and Kilo - the team's done a lot of work on that implementation - the built-in agent implementation. We've really made that a lot better, and Kilo should be a pretty solid release for people. And we're still doing improvements in Liberty for this.</p>

<p>In parallel, we've helped to enable the platform so things like OpenDaylight, OpenContrails, <a href="http://www.midokura.com/midonet/">Midonet</a>, all of these new projects, OVN, they can also enable and implement the APIs as well, because there's a lot of groups working there.</p>

<p>It's a challenging thing when you're trying to build this platform, and you have your own implementation of it, and you're trying to enable these other groups, too. But I think we've learned a lot over the last year, and the team has done a good job.</p>

<p>R: When I first started hearing about OpenDaylight, it was this magical thing where you could draw lines between blobs and networking would just happen. It feels like maybe that's a long way away, but is there going to be a time when I don't have to be a networking scholar to use OpenStack?</p>

<p>K: Yes, that ultimately is the goal. We're definitely working to get there. So that you as an operator can provide this scalable tenant networking to your tenants, and you as a tenant can just consume it.  And I think we're getting there. I'm hopeful that it's going to be soon.</p>

<p>So, speaking of the future, one of the things that we're looking at beyond Liberty that we've actually spent a lot of Liberty talking about has been this concept of an L3 network as well. So right now the API specifies networks of L2 broadcast domains, and we have subnets and ports and routers and things. It turns out that a lot of operators, especially operators at scale, like GoDaddy and RackSpace and Yahoo, they're very interested in breaking up what a network means, perhaps introducing the concept of an L3 network. They might want to do L3 just per-rack, for example.</p>

<p>This has been a great cycle because we've spent a lot of time with these operators understanding their use case, and we've really refined this. In fact I just literally got out of a meeting. I dialed in remotely to the ops midcycle for this. I think we have this nailed down so that we can get the spec done now and get it approved, and then in <a href="http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/openstack-pins-down-next-release-name-mitaka">Mitaka</a> we can implement this. This will really help these large deployers, and these large operators, and I think it's going to be a good change.</p>

<p>R: Before we started talking on mic, you were talking about the next cycle, and how Neutron will be tagged in that. Tell us more about that.</p>

<p>K: There were a couple of big developments. The community as a whole has really been working to bring Neutron in, because … The quick back-story is Nova networking has been around for a long time.  Neutron's been around for 4 years now. We're getting close to the point where hopefully we can finally deprecate Nova network. We're not quite there. But the community as a whole has done a couple of great things.</p>

<p>Number one, there was recently, as part of the tag process with new governance changes, someone proposed a <a href="http://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/compute_starter_kit.html">starter-kit:compute</a> tag, that was summarized as what services in OpenStack you need to bring up a small compute cluster. Initially that had Nova network. Now the interesting thing was, we as the Neutron team, we really pushed for Neutron on there, and it emerged with Nova network, but Monty Taylor actually proposed a patch to change it to Neutron, with the logic being, if you put someone in and start this cloud with Nova network, you can't really grow it and expand to Neutron.</p>

<p>So, it was great. The community came together and we all merged it, and so now Neutron is recommended.</p>

<p>Now, in parallel, I was just at the OpenStack board meeting, and I dialed into the <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Governance/DefCoreCommittee">Defcore</a> midcycle. The current cycle that they're starting for Defcore, they're going to focus on Neutron as the default networking there as well.</p>

<p>R: Great!</p>

<p>K: Yeah. So it's been really great to see the community come together and rally around Neutron.</p>

<p>R: The project's only five years old. Looking forward another five years, what do you envision for Neutron?</p>

<p>K: I really think that we're kind of evolving it to be this platform - to be a platform layer at this point. So the hope is that one of these great Open Source networking projects like OpenDaylight, for example, could maybe come in and become the default networking, or something like that - could become this rock-solid awesome thing.</p>

<p>R: That seemed to be their goal when they started out.</p>

<p>K: Yeah, and they're doing a great job. I've been involved with OpenDaylight, and there's a great team from Red Hat, amongst other companies, HP, Cisco, Brocade, a really good team up there that's working really hard, and doing a lot of great stuff, and making progress. It's been fun to see that.</p>

<p>So that's the goal, to make it a platform. One of the things we were looking at doing was spinning out the reference implementation into its own Gerrit repository, so it could be on equal footing with some of these other things that are out there. And I think we'll do that in Mitaka. We didn't quite do that in Liberty, but maybe then.</p>

<p>R: When I was doing a little research before we talked, I was looking at the Neutron Git repository. It seems that it's got more than any other project - just dozens of subprojects. If somebody wanted to get involved with Neutron, as a developer, is there an easy place - is there an easy in?</p>

<p>K: My recommendation would be, reach out in #openstack-neutron on Freenode. There's a lot of us core reviewers and other community members who are there are willing to help out. We have a lot of bugs in Launchpad, and we try to tag a bunch as low-hanging fruit, which hopefully are easy for initial developers, which also helps. And we've done a lot to enhance our DevRef - http://docs.openstack.org/developer/neutron/devref/ - documentation to hopefully make it easier for new developers to pull the tree and then go and look at what's there and say all this is documented better.  We've really focused on that so hopefully it's easier for new people to get involved. and contribute.</p>

<p>The documentation team in Openstack has been great. This cycle we had some members of that team along with some Neutron people really enhance the install guide. One of the things we did was we came up with a comparable install mode to what Nova network had. You could always do it in Neutron, it turns out it wasn't documented well. So we documented that. And the other thing is we had some of the documentation people … it turns out we have a lot of documentation in DevRef, around installation and configuration, that probably should live in the install or networking guide, and so that's moving there too. We're doing a lot of work there.</p>

<p>I'm really excited about, and it's really hard to believe Liberty is in two weeks. We're two weeks out, and I'm at LinuxCon. I was just in the cross-project meeting. At this point, we're really trying to focus on finishing Liberty. Then we'll take a small break, and ramp up for Mitaka again.</p>

<p>R: Thanks so much for your time.</p>

<p>K: Absolutely. Thanks, Rich.</p>

<p><strong>Scaling NFV to 213 Million Packets per Second with Red Hat Enterprise Linux, OpenStack, and DPDK</strong>
by Andrew Theurer</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>There is a lot of talk about NFV and OpenStack, but frankly not much hard data, showing us how well OpenStack can perform with technologies like DPDK. We at Red Hat want to know, and I suspect many of you do as well. So, we decided to see what RDO Kilo is capable of, by testing multiple Virtual Network Functions (VNFs), deployed and managed completely by OpenStack.</p>

<p><strong>Upgrades are dying, don’t die with them</strong>, by Maxime Payant-Chartier</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>We live in a world that has changed the way it consumes applications. The last few years have seen a rapid rise in the adoption of Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) and Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Much of this can be attributed to the broad success of Amazon Web Services (AWS), which is said to have grown revenue from $3.1B to $5B last year (Forbes). More and more people, enterprise customers included, are consuming applications and resources that require little to no maintenance. And any maintenance that does happen, now goes unnoticed by users. This leaves traditional software vendors contending to find a way to adapt their distribution models to make their software easier to consume. Lengthy, painful upgrades are no longer acceptable to users, forcing vendors to create a solution to this problem.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Quantum in Too Much Detail, I discussed the architecture of a Neutron deployment in detail. Since that article was published, Neutron gained the ability to handle multiple external networks with a single L3 agent. While I wrote about that back in 2014, I covered the configuration side of it in much more detail than I discussed the underlying network architecture. This post addresses the architecture side.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As OpenStack continues to grow into a mainstream Infrastructure-as-a-service (IaaS) platform, the industry seeks to learn more about its performance and scalability for use in production environments.

<audio controls="">

</audio>

<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Hi, this is Rich Bowen. I am the OpenStack Community Liaison at Red
Hat, and continuing my series on Project Technical Leads (PTLs) at
OpenStack, I'm talking with Davanum Srinivas, who I've known for a few
years outside of the OpenStack context, and he is the PTL for the <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Oslo">Oslo
project</a>.</p>

<p>Oslo is the OpenStack Commons Library.</p>

<p>Thanks for speaking with me Davanum.</p>

<p><strong>Dims</strong>: Thanks, Rich. You can call me Dims. You know me by Dims.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Yeah, I know. <em>laughs</em></p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Give us a little bit of background. How long has the Oslo project been around?</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>: We were doing things differently - we have a really old history,
though. Some of the initial effort was started back in release B.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Oh, that long ago.</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>: Yeah. So, what we were doing … why did Oslo come about? Oslo came
about because way back when Nova started, we started splitting code from Nova into separate projects. But these projects were sharing
code, so we were trying to figure out the best way to synchronize code
between these sibling or child projects. So we ended up with a single
repository of source code, called Oslo Incubator, where you would have
the master copy, and everybody would sync from there, but what was
happening was, everybody had their own sync schedule. Some people were
contributing patches back, and it was becoming hard to maintain those
patches. We decided we had to change the method the team worked. And
we started releasing libraries, for specific purposes. What you saw in
Kilo was a big bang explosion of a huge number of libraries from the
Oslo team. Most of it was code in Oslo Incubator. We just had to cut
the modules in a proper shape, sequence, with an API, with a correct
set of dependencies, and that's what we ended up releasing, one by
one. Other projects started using things like oslo.config,
oslo.messaging, oslo.db, oslo.log, and all these different libraries.</p>

<p>So that's where we are today.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: What is it that you'll be doing in coming releases? Is it just the
effort of identifying duplication, or are you actively developing new
libraries.</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>: Yes, we are. In Liberty, we have 5 new libraries coming up. Three
of them start with 'oslo.' - like oslo.cache, oslo.reports,
oslo.service. The other two do not have 'oslo' in their names. One is
called <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Oslo#automaton">Automaton</a>, the other is called <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Oslo#futurist">Futurist</a>.</p>

<p>Automaton is a library for building state machines and things like
that. Futurist is picking up some of the work that is done in upstream
futures and things like that and making it available to all of the
projects in the OpenStack ecosystem.</p>

<p>So these two projects can be used outside of Oslo, and outside of
OpenStack by other people. That's why they don't have the Oslo name in
them.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Do you see a lot of projects outside of OpenStack using these?</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>: We hope so. For example, there is a project called Debt Collector,
which we think fits well with how do you deprecate code and what are
the primitives that we can provide that make it easy to mark their
code being deprecated. A lot of people who work on Oslo also work in
the overall Python ecosystem, so the hope is that if we design the
libraries in such a way that it's reusable, other people will pick
some of our stuff up. But that's a stretch goal. The real goal is to
make sure that these libraries work well with the OpenStack projects.</p>

<p>And the other thing about these libraries is that they don't drag in
the Oslo baggage. For example, if you take oslo.db or oslo.messaging,
they pull in a lot of other Oslo libraries, and these little libraries
are designed so that they don't drag in other Oslo libraries. So
that's the other good thing about these.</p>

<p>The way the Oslo project has been for the last few cycles has been
that we are doing a lot of experiments in Oslo, which have been rolled
out to other projects in the OpenStack ecosystem. Oslo is slightly
different from other projects in the sense that people don't work on
it full time. So we have people work part time on it, but they focus
mainly on other bigger projects. They come here when they need a
feature or a fix, or things like that, and then they stay. We have a
few cores who monitor reviews and bugs across all of the Oslo projects,
but we also have people who specifically focus on individual little
libraries, and they get core rights there.</p>

<p>People in the OpenStack ecosystem are experimenting with different structures, like for
Neutron, they put everything into subrepos, and they experiement that
way. And I think that what we are doing might be more useful to Nova,
for example, and other projects, where they would like to keep a set
of cores together, and also have subsystem maintainers and things like
that.</p>

<p>Oslo is a good place to do this experimentation because the code base
is not that huge, and the community is not that big as well. And the
rate of churn, in terms of bugs and reviews, is not that high, as
well. We are also experimenting with release versioning and things
like that, and some of the things that you've seen recently driven by
Doug, across the OpenStack ecosystem, we tested it here first, in
terms of the versioning numbers, not having the Big Bang release, how
do we do it, and things like that.</p>

<p>We lead the way.</p>

<p>The other big thing is, for example, Python 3.4 support. All the Oslo
libraries have to be Python 3.4 complient first before they can be
used and the other projects can adopt. So we end up being in the
forefront trying to use libraries like websockify, or other libraries from
the OpenStack ecosystem, which are not Python 3.4 complient, and we
work with them to get them complient, and then use it in Oslo
libraries, and then we roll it in. So we play an important role, I
think, in the OpenStack ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: As PTL, is this a full time thing for you, or not? What are your
responsibilities as PTL?</p>

<p><strong>D</strong>: One of the very time consuming work is getting the releases out on
a weekly basis. We try to make it predictable. At least, this cycle,
we have started to make it predictable. Earlier, we heard complaints,
we don't know when you guys are releasing, so we were not ready, and
things like that. So we have a good process this time around, where,
over the weekend, we run a bunch of tests, outside of the CI, as well
as inside our CI system, to make sure that the master of all Oslo
libraries works well with Nova, Neutron, Glance, and things like that,
and come Monday morning, we decide which projects need releases, based
on what has changed in them for the last week or so. We follow the
release management guildelines, working with Doug and Thierry, to
generate the releases during the day on Monday.</p>

<p>After Tuesday you don't have to worry about Oslo releases breaking the
CI or your code. That has helped a lot of projects, especially Nova,
for example. If they know there is a break late on Monday evening,
they know who to ping, and we can start triaging the issue, and by
Tuesday they are back on their feet.</p>

<p>That's the worst-case scenario. Best-case scenario, no problem
happens, and we are good to go. But there's always one test case, or
one scenario here or there. We always try to test beforehand, but like
somebody said, it's a living thing - the ecosystem, the CI system, is
like an emergent behavior, it's a living thing. It's hard.</p>

<p><a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Zaqar">Zaqar</a> (formerly called Marconi) is the messaging service in <a href="http://openstack.org">OpenStack</a>. I recently had an opportunity to interview Flavio Percoco, who is the PTL (Project Technical Lead) of that project, about what's new in Kilo, and what's coming in <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Liberty_Release_Schedule">Liberty</a>.</p>

<p>R: This is Rich Bowen. I am the RDO community liaison at Red Hat, and
I'm speaking with Flavio Percoco, who is the PTL of the Zaqar project.
We spoke two years ago about the project, and at that time it had a
different name. I was hoping you could tell us what has been happening
in the Kilo cycle, and what we can expect to see in Liberty.</p>

<p>F: Thanks, Rich, for having me here. Yes, we spoke two years ago, back
in Hong Kong, while the project was called Marconi. Many things have
happened in these last few years. We developed new APIs, we've added
new features to the project.</p>

<p>At that time, we had version 1 of the API, and we were still figuring
out what the project was supposed to be like, and what features we
wanted to support, and after that we released a version 1.1 of the
API, which was pretty much the same thing, but with a few changes, and
a few things that would make consuming Zaqar easier for the final
user.</p>

<p>Some other things changed. The community provided a lot of feedback to
the project team. We've attempted to graduate two times, and then the
Big Tent discussion happened, and we just fell into the category of
projects that would be a good part of the community - of the Big Tent
discussion. So we are now officially part of OpenStack. We're part of
this Big Tent group.</p>

<p>We changed the API a little bit. The impression that the old API gave
was that it was a queueing service, whereas what we really wanted to
do was a messaging service. There is a fundamental difference between
the two. Our focus is to provide a messaging API for OpenStack that
would not just allow users to send messages from one point to another,
but it would also allow users to have notifications right away from
that API. So we'll take advantage of the common storage that we'll use
for both features, for different services living within the same
service. That's a big thing, and something we probably didn't talk
about back then.</p>

<p>The other thing is that in Kilo we dedicated a lot of time to work on
these versions of the API and making sure that all of the feedback
that we got from the community was taken care of and that we were
improving the API based on that feedback, and those long discussions
that we had on the mailing list.</p>

<p>In Liberty, we've dedicated time to integrating with other project, as
in, having other projects consume the API. So we're very excited to
say that in Liberty a few patches have landed in Heat that rely on
Zaqar for having notifications, or to send messages, and communicate
with other parts of the Heat service. This is very exciting for us,
because we have some stories of production environments, but we didn't
have stories of other projects consuming Zaqar, and this definitely
puts us in a better position to improve the service, and get more
feedback from the community.</p>

<p>In terms of features for the Liberty cycle, we've dedicated time to
improve the websocket transport which we started in Kilo, but didn't
have enough time to complete there. This websocket transport will
allow for persistent connections to be made against the Zaqar service,
so you'll just connect to the service once, and you'll keep that
connection alive. This is ideal for several scenarios, and one of
those is connecting to Zaqar from a browser and having Javascript
communication directory to Zaqar, which is something we really want to
have.</p>

<p>Another interesting feature that we implemented in Liberty is called
pre-signed URLs, and what it does is something very similar - if folks
are familiar with Swift temp URLs -
http://docs.openstack.org/kilo/config-reference/content/object-storage-tempurl.html
- this is something very similar to that. It generates a URL that
can expire. You will share that URL with people or services that don't
have an username in Zaqar, so that they can connect to the service and
still send messages. This URL is limited to a single tenant and a
single queue, and it has privileges and policies attached to it so
that we can protect all the data that is going through the service.</p>

<p>I believe those are the two features that excite me the most from the
Liberty cycle. But what excites me the most about this cycle is that
we have other services using Zaqar, and that will allow us to improve
our service a lot.</p>

<p>R: Looking forward to the future, is there anything that you would
like to see in the M cycle? What is the next big thing for Zaqar?</p>

<p>F: In the M cycle, I still see us working on having more projects
consuming Zaqar. There's several use cases that we've talked about
that are not being taken care of in the community. For instance,
talking to guest agents. We have several services that need to have an
agent running in the instances. We can talk about Trove, we can talk
about Sahara, and Murano. We are looking forward to address that use
case, which is what we built presigned URLs for. I'm not sure we're
going to make it in Liberty, because we're already on the last
milestone of the cycle, but we'll still try to make it in Liberty. If
we can't make it in Liberty, that's definitely one of the topics we'll
need to dedicate time to in the M cycle.</p>

<p>But as a higher level view, I
would really like to see a better story for Zaqar in terms of operations
support and deployment - make it very simple for people to go there
and say they want Zaqar, this is all I need, I have my Puppet
manifest, or Anisible playbooks, or whatever people are using now - we
want to address that area that we haven't paid much attention to.
There is already some effort in the Puppet community to create
manifests for Zaqar, which is amazing. We want to complete that work,
we want to tell operations, hey, you don't have to struggle to make that
happen, you don't have to struggle to run Zaqar, this is all you need.</p>

<p>And the second thing that I would like to see Zaqar doing in the
future is to have a better opinion of what the storage it wants to
rely on is. So far we have support for two storages that are unicode
based and there's a proposal to support a third storage, but in
reality what we would really like to do is have a more opinionated
Zaqar instance of storage, so that we can build a better API, make it
consistent, and make sure it is dependable, and provide specific
features that are supported and that it doesn't matter what storage
you are using, it doesn't matter how you deploy Zaqar, you'll always
get the same API, which is something that right now it's not true. If
you deploy Redis, for instance, you will not have support for FIFO
queues, which are optional right now in the service. You won't be able
to have them because that's something that's related to the storage
itself. You don't get the same guarantees that you'd get with other
storage. We want to have a single story that we can tell to users,
regardless of what storage they are using. This doesn't mean that ops
cannot use their own storage. If you deploy Zaqar and you really want
to use a different storage, that's fine, we're not going to remove
plugability from the service. But in terms of support, I would like
Zaqar to be more opinionated.</p>
