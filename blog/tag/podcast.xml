    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing my series of interviews with RDO engineers, here's my chat with Emilien Macchi, who I talked with at OpenStack Summit last week in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to talk about what you did in Mitaka, please contact me at &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#114;&amp;#098;&amp;#111;&amp;#119;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#104;&amp;#097;&amp;#116;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;"&gt;&amp;#114;&amp;#098;&amp;#111;&amp;#119;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#104;&amp;#097;&amp;#116;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm speaking with Emilien Macchi, who is one of the people that
worked on the Mitaka release of OpenStack. Thank you for taking time
to speak with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emilien&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you for welcoming me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: What did you do in Mitaka?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;: In Mitaka, most of my tasks were related to packaging testing. I'm
currently leading the Puppet OpenStack group, which is a team where we
develop some Puppet modules that deploy OpenStack in production. Red
Hat is using the Puppet modules in TripleO, so we can automate the
deployment of OpenStack services. Recently we switched the gates of
OpenStack Infra to use RDO packaging. We had a lot of issued before
because we didn't have much CI. But since Mitaka, the RDO and the
Puppet teams worked a lot together to make sure that we can provide
some testing together. We can fix things very early when it's broken
upstream. Like when we have a new dependency or when we have a change
in the requirements. That was this kind of test where you provide very
early feedback to the RDO people that are doing the packaging. It was
very interesting to work with RDO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We provided early feedback on the builds, on the failures. We also
contributed to … I say "we", I don't like to say "I" … we, my
group, my Puppet group, we contributed to the new packages that we
have in Mitaka. We updated the spec in the package so we could have
more features, and more services in the RDO projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing! Testing every day. Testing, testing, testing. Participating
in the events that the RDO community is having, like the weekly
meetings, the testing days. It was very interesting for us to have
this relationship with the RDO team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I'm looking forward to Newton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: What do you anticipate you'll be working on in Newton?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, that's an interesting question. We are talking about this
week. [At OpenStack Summit, Austin.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for us … the biggest challenge, I guess, is to follow
the release velocity of upstream projects. We have a bunch of projects
in OpenStack, and it's very hard to catch up with all of the projects
at the same time. In the meantime we have to because those projects,
they are in the RDO project and also in the products, so that's
something we need to … we need to scale the way that we producing
all this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something we are very focused on right now is to use the Software
Factory project, which is how OpenStack Infra is operating to build
OpenStack software. This is a project - an open source project - which
is now used by RDO. We can have this same way as upstream, but for
downstream - we can have the same way to produce the RDO artifacts,
like the packages and the Puppet modules, and so on. That's the next
big challenge, is to be fully integrated with Software Factory, to
implement the missing features we will need to make the testing
better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that's the biggest challenge: Improve the testing, and stopping
doing manual things, automate all the things, that is the next
challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;We're continuing our series of "What did you do in Mitaka?"
interviews. This one is with Javier Peña.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe src="https://www.podbean.com/media/player/82a4c-5ec74f?from=yiiadmin" data-link="https://www.podbean.com/media/player/82a4c-5ec74f?from=yiiadmin" height="100" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-name="pb-iframe-player"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If the above player doesn't work for you, you can download the file &lt;a href="https://rdocommunity.podbean.com/mf/play/fgk3cc/javier-pena-mitaka.mp3"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich&lt;/strong&gt;: Today I'm speaking with Javier Peña, who is another member
of the Red Hat OpenStack engineering team. Thanks for making time to
speak with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Javier&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you very much for inviting me, Rich.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: What did you work on in the Mitaka cycle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt;: I've been focusing on three main topics. First one was keeping the
DLRN infrastructure up and running. As you know, this is the service
we use to create RPM packages for our RDO distribution, straight from
the upstream master commits.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's been evolving quite a lot during this cycle. We ended up with so
much success that we're having infrastructure issues. One of the
topics for the next cycle will be to improve the infrastructure, but
that's something we'll talk about later.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These packages have now been consumed by the TripleO, Kolla, and
Puppet OpenStack CI, so we're quite well tested. Not only are we
testing them directly from the RDO trunk repositories, but we have
external trials as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On top of that I have also been working on packaging, just like some
other colleagues on the team who've you've already had a chance to
talk to - Haikel, Chandan - I have been contributing packages both to
upstream Fedora, and also RDO directly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And finally, I'm also one of the core maintainers of Packstack. In
this cycle we've been adding support for some services such as AODH
and Gnocchi. Also we switched Mysql support from the Python side. We
switched libraries, and we had to do some work with the upstream
Puppet community to make sure that PyMysql, which is now the default
Python library used upstream, is also used inside the Puppet core and
we can use it in Packstack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: You mentioned briefly infrastructure changes that you'll be making
in the upcoming cycle. Can you tell us more about what you have
planned for Newton?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt;: Right now the DLRN infrastructure is building 6 different lines of
repositories. We have CentOS master, which is now Newton. Mitaka,
Liberty, and Kilo. And we have two branches for Fedora as well. So
this is quite a heavy load for VMs that we're running right now. We
were having some issues in the cloud we were running that instance. So
what we're doing now is we are migrating to the CentOS CI
infrastructure. We are having a much bigger machine in there. And also
what we are going to do is we will be publishing the resulting
repositories using the CentOS CDN, which is way more reliable than
what we could build with individual VMs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you again for your time. And we look forward to seeing what
comes in Newton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;J&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you very much, Rich.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this installment of the "What Did You Do in Mitaka" series, I'm
speaking with Haïkel Guémar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe id="audio_iframe" src="https://www.podbean.com/media/player/z8zks-5ea7c6?from=yiiadmin" data-link="http://www.podbean.com/media/player/z8zks-5ea7c6?from=yiiadmin" height="100" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-name="pb-iframe-player"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks for making time to speak with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haïkel&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: So, tell me, what did you do in Mitaka?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: I work on the &lt;a href="http://rdoproject.org"&gt;RDO&lt;/a&gt; engineering team - the team that is responsible
for the stewardship of RDO. For this cycle, I've been focusing on our
new packaging work flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were using, for a long time, a piece of infrastructure taken from
Fedora, CentOS, and GitHub. This didn't work very well, and was not
providing a consistent experience for the contributors. So we've been
working with another team at Red Hat to provide a more integrated
platform, and one that mirrors the one that we have upstream, based on
the same tools - meaning Git, Gerrit, Jenkins, Nodepool, Zuul - that is
called &lt;a href="https://github.com/redhat-cip/software-factory"&gt;Software Factory&lt;/a&gt;. So we've been working with the Software
Factory team to provide a specialization of that platform called
&lt;a href="https://github.com/redhat-cip/rpmfactory"&gt;RPMFactory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RPMFactory is a platform specialized for producing RPMs in a
continuous delivery fashion. It has all the advantages of the old
tooling we have been using, but with more consistency. You don't have
to look in different places to find the source code, the packaging,
and stuff like that. Everything is under a single portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's what I've been focusing on during this cycle, on top of my
usual duties, which is producing packages and fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: And looking forward to the Newton release, what do you think you're
going to be working on in that cycle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: While we've been working in the new workflow, we've been setting a
new goal, that is to decrease the gap between upstream releases and
RDO releases down to 2 weeks. Well, we did it &lt;a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/rdo-mitaka-released/"&gt;on the very same day&lt;/a&gt; for
Mitaka! So my goal would be for Newton to do as good as this time, or
even better. Why not under 2 hours? Not putting on ourselves more
pressure, but to try to release almost at the same time as upstream
GA, RDO. And also with the same quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the few things that I was not happy with during the Mitaka
cycle was mostly the fact that we didn't manage to release some
packages in time, so I'd like to do better. Soon enough I will be
asking for people to fill in a wish list on packaging, so that we are
able to work on that earlier. And so we could release them on time
with GA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks again for taking the time to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you Rich, for the series.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this installment of our "What did you do in Mitaka?" series, Ihar Hrachyshka talks about his work on Neutron both in Mitaka, and what's planned for Newton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can listen below. If the player doesn't work for you, you can listen &lt;a href="http://rdocommunity.podbean.com/mf/web/sipki2/ihar_hrachyshka_mitaka.mp3/"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe id="audio_iframe" src="https://www.podbean.com/media/player/7ximn-5e7230" width="100%" height="100" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich&lt;/strong&gt;: Hello, I'm speaking with &lt;a href="http://tm3.org/64"&gt;Ihar Hrachyshka&lt;/a&gt; about the work that he did
in the RDO community on the &lt;a href="http://releases.openstack.org/mitaka/index.html"&gt;Mitaka release of OpenStack&lt;/a&gt;. Thank you for
taking time to speak with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Ihar&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you for having me&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: Could you mention the things that you've worked on in Mitaka, both
upstream, and also specifically for &lt;a href="http://rdoproject.org"&gt;RDO&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;: One thing that I was focusing on during Mitaka in upstream is - we
are looking at how we can enhance the upgrade story for the project I
work on, which is &lt;a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron"&gt;Neutron&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(See &lt;a href="http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/neutron/mitaka.html"&gt;Neutron Mitaka release notes&lt;/a&gt;  )&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There was a lot of good work done in this regard on other projects, in
previous cycles, like in Nova. And Neutron was kind of lagging on
that. During Mitaka, we formed a sub-team that looks specifically into
the upgrade story, and we've identified several pain points that we
were addressing during this cycle, and plan to continue the work in
Neutron, and forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One thing that we've identified is even though so-called rolling
upgrades were kind of supported in the sense that there was some code
to handle that scenario, for upgrades. But it was never actually
validated in our CI gate, so no-one could be sure that it actually
worked. So that was one thing that we tackled. We added proper jobs to
validate these scenarios, and make sure that they work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another thing for upgrades is that we are looking at reducing and
maybe even eliminating any downtime for API endpoints for Neutron,
especially in the case when you have highly-available controllers. That
involves a lot of work in the code base, a lot of change there to
refactor the code. We've already started the work during Mitaka, and
we're going to proceed with that in Newton. We hope that we complete
this work in Newton, and then for all upgrades starting from Newton to
the next release, operators will be able to retain their Neutron API
available while controllers are upgraded one by one. That's one thing
that I was working on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are other things. There was a lot of work done in Neutron in the
scope of Quality of Service (QOS). The initial support for QOS in
Neutron was merged in Liberty, but it's still quite limited, so we
expand on what we had done in that release. Specifically, the initial
support was just for OpenVSwitch, but in Mitaka we added support for
Linuxbridge ml2 driver. We also added role-based access control for QOS
policies. We added support for so-called DSCP tags, which is a feature
to prioritize traffic based on which port it came from.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another interesting thing that we finally tackled in Mitaka is MTU
support. This is one of the huge pain points that were identified
by operators in the past, that Neutron, while being the networking
solution for OpenStack, cannot actually properly handle MTUs - which
stands for Maximum Transfer Unit. Neutron could not actually handle,
neither standard MTUs for ethernet, nor so-called jumbo frames, which
is really bad. It means that instances did not have access to the full
capabilities of the underlying physical infrastructure. That should
hopefully go away in Mitaka, because there were several changes there,
both on the Neutron side, and on Nova, which now should make Neutron
work out of the box, both for non-standard and standard MTU sizes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, one thing to note, apart from pure upstream work in the
Master branch, is that in Neutron, in this Mitaka release, we adopted
a new approach to handle backports for stable branches. Now instead of
waiting for something to break in a user installation, and then
reacting to their bug reports, we are proactively backporting all of
the bug fixes from the latest master branch into stable branches, and
release new stable releases, often. We hope that it will reduce the
number of painful problems, in actual installations that rely on stable
branches, very significantly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: This sounds like an enormous amount of work. How many people are
you working with across how many organizations, would you estimate?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;I&lt;/strong&gt;: In OpenStack it's always that you work with other people. I would
say … I don't know … there are I think 5, 6, major contributors to
Neutron. Surely, nothing comes in OpenStack if you're just single. So
that's collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you very much for your time, and we look forward to seeing
what comes in Newton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This continues my &lt;a href="/blog/ptl-interviews"&gt;series talking with OpenStack project PTLs&lt;/a&gt; (Project Technical Leads) about their projects, what's new in Liberty, and what's coming in future releases.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the audio player below doesn't work for you, you can listen to the interview &lt;a href="http://drbacchus.com/podcasts/openstack/haikel_packaging.mp3"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt; or

&lt;audio controls=""&gt;
  &lt;source src="http://drbacchus.com/podcasts/openstack/haikel_packaging.mp3" type="audio/mpeg" /&gt;
&lt;/audio&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm Rich Bowen, I'm the community liaison for the OpenStack project
at Red Hat. I'm speaking with Haikel Guemar, who is the Project
Technical Lead (PTL) on the &lt;a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Rpm-packaging"&gt;RPM packaging project&lt;/a&gt; at OpenStack. Thanks
for taking this time to speak with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you, Rich. I appreciate it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: This is a fairly new project, in terms of actually being part of
OpenStack - is that right?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, exactly. We've been an official project for a few months, and
we're still in bootstrapping. There has been some discussion at the
last Summit to converge packaging project to work together, upstream.
After some discussion we discussion, we decided to split between two
separate projects, one around Debian packaging, and one around RPM
packaging. So we've been working with people from RDO, SUSE, and also
some people from Mirantis, to work together on RPM packaging upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By the way, I'm co-PTL of the project. I'm co-leading the project with
Dirk Mueller from SUSE. Hats off to Dirk, if you're listening to us.
We're trying to bring packaging into the heart of the project, because
OpenStack is fairly good at trying to develop its own software
pipeline, and the only bit that was missing was packaging - the last
missing bit between the project and the end-user.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, we've been trying to do that, and also help the upstream project
to understand what are our needs upstream, because we have very
specific requirements that we want them to hear.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: How do you picture this project changing the downstream projects like
RDO and Fuel? Do you think there will be a big impact on those, or
will they go on as though nothing's changed?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: I think there will be some impact, because if all the downstream
packages are working on this, at some point we will be able to produce
multiple packagings. There will still be some differences, but what we
are working on - trying to mitigate them and trying to share most of
our workers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Speaking now with my RDO hat - I do hope that at some point, RDO will
derive from our upstream RPM packaging. That's what we want to do - be
closer to upstream. That's the point of RDO, not of the upstream
project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: Looking forward to that time, what would then be the role of
projects like RDO, and Fuel. Would they still be relevant, or do you
see them going away long term.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: Tough question. I think they will still be there, because at some
point we will be targeting very different segments. For instance, RDO
itself is the upstream for other downstream distributions of
OpenStack. Like, obviously, the Red Hat one, or Cisco's, or many
others. I think that maybe RDO might disappear, maybe, but we still
want to have some degree of integration. I hope that most of it will
go upstream, because that's where people are working, and we want to
deal with before it reaches the users, not after we release.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: In Liberty, and even more in future releases, with the integrated
release kind of going away, and more reliance on tags, is the RPM
packaging project going to package everything, or just a particular
tag, or will that be up to the community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: That will be up to the community. The core upstream RPM packaging
team will be working on core projects. We will be looking at Big Tent
projects according to our own drive. But if people want to contribute
any other Big Tent projects, they are welcome to do it. We are really
looking forward to extending the comunity. We're still a small team so
we will be focusing on core OpenStack. Currently we're working on
clients because that's what everyone needs to work with OpenStack, and
when we're done, then we'll start working on services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: One of the things that RDO does is the CI effort within the CentOS
infrastructure. And there's obviously also a lot of that happening in
the upstream OpenStack. Will the RPM packaging rely on the upstream
for this?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: We had some talks about it, and that was a funny discussion,
because we discovered that our respective CI are more or less the same
steps, and encounter the same issues. So we are willing to push more
of the CI upstream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I personally hope - but it's not something that we agreed on - I hope
that we will become part of the continuous delivery pipeline of
OpenStack. That means that every commit from upstream would be
packaged and then introduced into the CI, and then these patches would
be usable for other CI, since we don't have any concrete example, I
will take one from RDO. We've been working with Puppet upstream CI
recently, as they wanted to have come CI on CentOS, so we've been
working on fixing staging issues that were affecting their CI so they
could test properly Puppet upstream modules on CentOS. That was
amazing because they helped us find many many issues that we were able to
solve very early. And that's what I hope for the upstream RPM project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: I noticed that they are no candidates for the PTL for the project
in the coming election. Is that just because the project is so new,
you're not going to have turnover in that?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: Yeah, that was the discussion just this afternoon about it. We're
still new, and we don't want to confuse people with elections just
now. We're still building the community, and we've been working on
that with Dirk. The project won't be leaderless. It's still difficult
too, because we still have so much to do.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main difference between the RPM packaging team and other teams is
that we're not solely dedicated to work on upstream tasks, like
Cinder, Glance, or Nova. We have much more downstream-focused teams,
so we wanted to stay focused. So we thought we would just keep the
same PTLs for the next cycle. And then when we are more mature we will
have candidacy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: As PTL … it's been interesting talking with various projects,
because the role of PTL can vary a great deal depending on the size
and maturity of the project. I was wondering if you could tell us what
your responsibilities are as PTL.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: Our responsibility is ensuring that all the community team is
aligned around the same goals. It means also trying to gather new
members. For instance, being the PTL brings the attention on you, so
people contact you so they can join the project. As we are still
small, that was a critical path, and I have been trying to have them
join the team, and make them active participants. I've been pretty
happy that, for instance, Mirantis people reached out to me, and
they've been able to join, and I appreciate that. One of the other
things is to ensure that we are working together. I'm pretty happy
that I am co-PTL with Dirk, because we can share the load. It is very
tiring. We have to schedule meetings and gather people. Recently we
had a hack day, to solve some of our impediments. We have to ensure
that we have enough people, and we have the right people, to help. For
instance, we have tooling issues, so I tried to get some people who
would be likely to work on that aspect available for that day. I do
not view the PTL as someone who decides everything. It's more about
being the coordinator.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: Finally: if somebody does want to get involved in the project,
where should they come? Is it to the mailing list, or IRC, or what?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: We're still using the openstack-devel mailing list with 'RPM
Packaging' topics. We have an IRC channel on Freenode, which is
#openstack-rpm-packaging. We have regular meetings every two weeks on
Thursday. We sometimes have an additional meeting, at the same time.
We keep logs of our agenda. And if you need anything else, just ping
&lt;code&gt;number80&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;dirk&lt;/code&gt; on the channel, and we'd be happy to help you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you again for taking time to speak with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;
