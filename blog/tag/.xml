    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Because of its unique branding and name, one might assume that "RDO Manager" is not TripleO - perhaps it has additional downstream patches or maybe they're entirely different projects. You would not be alone because the community, the users and the developers alike have shared their confusion on this topic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The truth is "RDO Manager" really is "TripleO". There is no code or documentation difference.  The only thing that is different is the strategy around how the RDO community tests TripleO to ensure the stability of RDO packages but even this strategy is in the process of being sent upstream because we're convinced it's the best way forward.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Historically, RDO Manager and TripleO were different projects. Today this is no longer the case and we plan on keeping it that way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Further, there is no other project in RDO that is renamed or rebranded. OpenStack Nova is referenced as Nova within the RDO project. Even the TripleO packages in RDO have the same naming as the upstream projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With this in mind, on Wednesday, 24th, February, 2016, the RDO community discussed and voted to drop the "RDO Manager" brand and use TripleO instead. This will clear the confusion surrounding the topic of what IS RDO Manager as well as strengthen the TripleO name.  It is our hope that a clear 1:1 mapping between the projects will result in more integration with upstream on the CI side as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Over the course of the next few weeks, the RDO community will work towards replacing mentions of "RDO Manager" in documentation, web sites, code, and repositories. If you'd like to help with this, please join us on irc Freenode #rdo.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Using a custom ssh config with Ansible’s synchronize module&lt;/strong&gt;, by Harry Rybacki&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Have you ever needed to specify which ssh config file rsync should use when called from Ansible’s synchronize module? I have and it was not obvious how to do so.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Keystone on Port 80 For Tripleo&lt;/strong&gt; by Adam Young&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Many services assume that Keystone listens on ports 5000 and 35357. I’d prefer to have Keystone listen on the standard HTTP(s) ports of 80 and 443. We can’t remove the non-standard ports without a good deal of rewriting. But there is nothing preventing us from running Keystone on port 80 or 443 in addition to those ports.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Skydive : a real-time network analyzer&lt;/strong&gt; by  Sylvain Afchain&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;SDN solutions are complex and troubleshooting/monitoring them is even harder. It seems that while we have a better way to automate the network we lose visibility and operability. For example, in order to troubleshoot an issue you have of to understand the network in general but also to have a deep understanding of how the SDN solution is implementing the network. And if you have multiple SDN solutions deployed – with maybe nested SDN solutions like container network in VMs – finding the root cause of an issue starts to be really hard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hackery to get going RDO Kilo on Fedora 23&lt;/strong&gt; by Boris Derzhavets&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
  &lt;p&gt;Sequence of hacks required to get going RDO Kilo on Fedora 23 is caused by existence of many areas where Nova has a hard dependency on Glance v1. Per https://specs.openstack.org/openstack/nova-specs/specs/mitaka/approved/use-glance-v2-api.html&lt;/p&gt;
