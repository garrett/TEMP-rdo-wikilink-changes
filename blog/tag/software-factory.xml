    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Continuing my series of interviews with RDO engineers, here's my chat with Emilien Macchi, who I talked with at OpenStack Summit last week in Austin.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to talk about what you did in Mitaka, please contact me at &lt;a href="&amp;#109;&amp;#097;&amp;#105;&amp;#108;&amp;#116;&amp;#111;:&amp;#114;&amp;#098;&amp;#111;&amp;#119;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#104;&amp;#097;&amp;#116;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;"&gt;&amp;#114;&amp;#098;&amp;#111;&amp;#119;&amp;#101;&amp;#110;&amp;#064;&amp;#114;&amp;#101;&amp;#100;&amp;#104;&amp;#097;&amp;#116;&amp;#046;&amp;#099;&amp;#111;&amp;#109;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich&lt;/strong&gt;: I'm speaking with Emilien Macchi, who is one of the people that
worked on the Mitaka release of OpenStack. Thank you for taking time
to speak with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Emilien&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you for welcoming me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: What did you do in Mitaka?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;: In Mitaka, most of my tasks were related to packaging testing. I'm
currently leading the Puppet OpenStack group, which is a team where we
develop some Puppet modules that deploy OpenStack in production. Red
Hat is using the Puppet modules in TripleO, so we can automate the
deployment of OpenStack services. Recently we switched the gates of
OpenStack Infra to use RDO packaging. We had a lot of issued before
because we didn't have much CI. But since Mitaka, the RDO and the
Puppet teams worked a lot together to make sure that we can provide
some testing together. We can fix things very early when it's broken
upstream. Like when we have a new dependency or when we have a change
in the requirements. That was this kind of test where you provide very
early feedback to the RDO people that are doing the packaging. It was
very interesting to work with RDO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We provided early feedback on the builds, on the failures. We also
contributed to … I say "we", I don't like to say "I" … we, my
group, my Puppet group, we contributed to the new packages that we
have in Mitaka. We updated the spec in the package so we could have
more features, and more services in the RDO projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Testing! Testing every day. Testing, testing, testing. Participating
in the events that the RDO community is having, like the weekly
meetings, the testing days. It was very interesting for us to have
this relationship with the RDO team.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I'm looking forward to Newton.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: What do you anticipate you'll be working on in Newton?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;: Well, that's an interesting question. We are talking about this
week. [At OpenStack Summit, Austin.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for us … the biggest challenge, I guess, is to follow
the release velocity of upstream projects. We have a bunch of projects
in OpenStack, and it's very hard to catch up with all of the projects
at the same time. In the meantime we have to because those projects,
they are in the RDO project and also in the products, so that's
something we need to … we need to scale the way that we producing
all this work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Something we are very focused on right now is to use the Software
Factory project, which is how OpenStack Infra is operating to build
OpenStack software. This is a project - an open source project - which
is now used by RDO. We can have this same way as upstream, but for
downstream - we can have the same way to produce the RDO artifacts,
like the packages and the Puppet modules, and so on. That's the next
big challenge, is to be fully integrated with Software Factory, to
implement the missing features we will need to make the testing
better.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, that's the biggest challenge: Improve the testing, and stopping
doing manual things, automate all the things, that is the next
challenge.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;E&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you for your time.&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;In this installment of the "What Did You Do in Mitaka" series, I'm
speaking with Haïkel Guémar&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;iframe id="audio_iframe" src="https://www.podbean.com/media/player/z8zks-5ea7c6?from=yiiadmin" data-link="http://www.podbean.com/media/player/z8zks-5ea7c6?from=yiiadmin" height="100" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-name="pb-iframe-player"&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;

&lt;p&gt;(If the above player doesn't work for you, you can download the audio &lt;a href="https://rdocommunity.podbean.com/mf/play/pfcayj/haikel-guemar-mitaka.mp/"&gt;HERE&lt;/a&gt;.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Rich&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks for making time to speak with me.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Haïkel&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: So, tell me, what did you do in Mitaka?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: I work on the &lt;a href="http://rdoproject.org"&gt;RDO&lt;/a&gt; engineering team - the team that is responsible
for the stewardship of RDO. For this cycle, I've been focusing on our
new packaging work flow.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We were using, for a long time, a piece of infrastructure taken from
Fedora, CentOS, and GitHub. This didn't work very well, and was not
providing a consistent experience for the contributors. So we've been
working with another team at Red Hat to provide a more integrated
platform, and one that mirrors the one that we have upstream, based on
the same tools - meaning Git, Gerrit, Jenkins, Nodepool, Zuul - that is
called &lt;a href="https://github.com/redhat-cip/software-factory"&gt;Software Factory&lt;/a&gt;. So we've been working with the Software
Factory team to provide a specialization of that platform called
&lt;a href="https://github.com/redhat-cip/rpmfactory"&gt;RPMFactory&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;RPMFactory is a platform specialized for producing RPMs in a
continuous delivery fashion. It has all the advantages of the old
tooling we have been using, but with more consistency. You don't have
to look in different places to find the source code, the packaging,
and stuff like that. Everything is under a single portal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That's what I've been focusing on during this cycle, on top of my
usual duties, which is producing packages and fixing it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: And looking forward to the Newton release, what do you think you're
going to be working on in that cycle?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: While we've been working in the new workflow, we've been setting a
new goal, that is to decrease the gap between upstream releases and
RDO releases down to 2 weeks. Well, we did it &lt;a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/rdo-mitaka-released/"&gt;on the very same day&lt;/a&gt; for
Mitaka! So my goal would be for Newton to do as good as this time, or
even better. Why not under 2 hours? Not putting on ourselves more
pressure, but to try to release almost at the same time as upstream
GA, RDO. And also with the same quality standards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the few things that I was not happy with during the Mitaka
cycle was mostly the fact that we didn't manage to release some
packages in time, so I'd like to do better. Soon enough I will be
asking for people to fill in a wish list on packaging, so that we are
able to work on that earlier. And so we could release them on time
with GA.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt;: Thanks again for taking the time to do this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;H&lt;/strong&gt;: Thank you Rich, for the series.&lt;/p&gt;
