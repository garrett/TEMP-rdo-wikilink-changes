    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;OpenStack engineers met in Austin last week to design the Newton cycle.
Here is a report for the &lt;a href="https://security.openstack.org"&gt;Security Project&lt;/a&gt;
and other associated efforts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="requirements-for-the-vulnerabilitymanaged-governance-tag"&gt;Requirements for the vulnerability:managed governance tag&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During Mitaka, the vulnerability management team ("VMT") introduced a new
vulnerability:managed tag to help identify supported projects.
In essence, this tag indicates that a project's security bug reports are triaged by the VMT
&lt;a href="http://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#incident-report-taxonomy"&gt;taxonomy&lt;/a&gt;.
For class A reports, the VMT issues an OpenStack Security Advisory ("OSSA").&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The VMT documented a set of requirements to get the tag:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deliverable repositories,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Dedicated point of contact, usualy a subset of the core team called coresec,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;PTL agrees to act as a VMT liaison to escalate severe issues,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bug tracker reconfiguration, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Third-party review/audit/threat analysis.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last point (item 5) intends to ensure that the VMT doesn't become a
bottleneck for projects with poor security practices or that have unknown
fundamental flaws.
By design, the VMT is a small team, composed of 3 volunteers.
Thus, new projects must demonstrate that they won't cause an unmanageable
number of security bug reports.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the next section, I will set-out how we can efficiently increase the
number of vulnerability:managed projects as designed during the Newton summit
&lt;a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/security-newton-summit-threatanalysis"&gt;etherpad&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-vmt-members-need-to-know"&gt;What VMT members need to know&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since day 1, doing VMT work for OpenStack has been a challenging task due to:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A wide attack surface,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Source code and api version changes,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deployment modes with distinct threats, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Coordination between different communities.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the list of questions that need to be answered when managing a new
project:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What are the input data formats and how are they processed ?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Which actions are restricted to operators ?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What has been considered a vulnerability in previous bug reports ?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;What can a malicious user do depends on:
    &lt;ul&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Available services, including the non-obvious ones, such as nova-novncproxy,&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;API endpoint paths, including old versions, such as glance v1, and&lt;/li&gt;
      &lt;li&gt;Every other network-facing service to which a user can connect.&lt;/li&gt;
    &lt;/ul&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A document answering the above questions will likely be required for any
vulnerability:managed tag application.
Moreover, already supported projects will also need to validate the above
requirements in order to keep the tag.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This document needs to be maintained within the OpenStack community using
open code review. The &lt;a href="http://docs.openstack.org/sec/"&gt;security-guide&lt;/a&gt; or
project documentation are appropriate locations to publish it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is the proposed
&lt;a href="http://openstack-security.github.io/collaboration/2016/04/26/threat-analysis-process.html"&gt;threat analysis process&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href="http://openstack-security.github.io/threatanalysis/2016/02/07/anchorTA.html"&gt;Anchor&lt;/a&gt;'s
threat analysis.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="stable-release"&gt;Stable Release&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Major changes to the OpenStack release process were introduced last cycles:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Integrated releases, such as 2015.1.2 are now gone,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Projects may use different release models,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Unified versions numbers &lt;a href="http://semver.org"&gt;semver&lt;/a&gt;, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Automated publication to &lt;a href="http://releases.openstack.org/"&gt;website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The "stable summit" set new goals for the Newton cycle:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Increase stable release support to 18 months with an option for 6 additional
months,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Backwards compatibility for libraries, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Co-installability requirements.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;End of life policy is the most important topic for the VMT since it increases
the number of supported branchs. Infra and QA are also directly affected since
they have to maintain the CI capacity for supported stable releases. While in
theory it's possible to extend support, here is a list of practical blockers to
be addressed:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Stable branch gates break too often, see
&lt;a href="http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health/#/g/build_queue/periodic-stable"&gt;openstack-health&lt;/a&gt;,&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Backport to old releases is time consuming when the affected code went
through several refactors, and&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Long Term Stable (LTS) versions aren't an option because upgrade process
must deploy each versions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In summary, Kilo release end of life won't be extended and the branch will
likely be closed soon, EOL: 2016-05-02. Further, external dependencies
requirements are not supported by the VMT, but it is worth noting that a new
Requirement Team will be created to manage this increasingly difficult
situation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More details in those two etherpads:
&lt;a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/stable-branch-eol-policy-newton"&gt;eol-policy&lt;/a&gt;
and
&lt;a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/newton-stable-summit"&gt;stable summit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="issue-tracker"&gt;Issue tracker&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last but not least, there was a
&lt;a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/newton-infra-community-task-tracking"&gt;design session&lt;/a&gt;
to discuss issue tracker for OpenStack projects. This is a critical topic for
vulnerability management since most VMT work actually happens on the issue
tracker.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenStack projects currently use launchpad.net to track issues and write
blueprints for feature tracking. The workflow being sub-optimal, there is an
on-going effort to replace launchpad by something better. Migration issues
aside, the real concern is that we may end up with another sub-optimal solution
which doesn't justify the migration cost.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the other hand, the OpenStack community initiated
&lt;a href="https://storyboard.openstack.org"&gt;storyboard&lt;/a&gt; which is designed to address
the exceptional needs of OpenStack development. Unfortunately, the project
stalled due to the lack of reviewers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OpenStack community has three main options regarding issue tracking:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Develop its own issue tracker (e.g. storyboard),&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Operate a ready-to-use solution (e.g. maniphest), or&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use an external service (e.g. launchpad).&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This topic will be discussed in the following weeks.
Hopefully it will lead to a long term decision from the TC with Infra
approval.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="conclusion"&gt;Conclusion&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, we have made great progress and I'm looking forward to further
developments.
Thank you all for the great OpenStack Newton Design Summit!&lt;/p&gt;
