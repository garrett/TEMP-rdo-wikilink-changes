    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;On July 9th, 11am Eastern time, Eoghan Glynn will be leading a hangout in which he'll discuss what's coming in Ceilometer in the Juno release. You can register to attend (so you'll get a reminder) and attend the actual event, at https://plus.google.com/events/c6e8vjjn8klrf78ruhkr95j4tas&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If the time isn't convenient, you'll be able to watch the archived video at that same location afterwards.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please come to the #rdo-hangout channel on the Freenode IRC network for discussion and questions during the event.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ceilometer is the metering/monitoring component of OpenStack. You can read more about it at http://docs.openstack.org/developer/ceilometer/&lt;/p&gt;

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Since we've noticed that a large percentage of questions on the RDO Forum are focused on networking, we're planning to have a Google Hangout on September 24th, at 12pm Eastern time, (9am Pacific, 17:00 GMT, http://bit.ly/1cnEZEN for your local timezone.) You can see the hangout details, and let us know you're coming, at https://plus.google.com/events/cph9aq3a6ag1lb17g3gsvaiiljg&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The presentation will be a short overview of networking in OpenStack, the relative roles of Neutron, OVS, a little bit on where OpenDaylight and OpenFlow fit into the equation, and then a walk-through of the basic L2 &amp;amp; L3 workflows that people usually want to do in Neutron, and work through a couple of common situations where people have trouble ("Can't ping my VM, can't associate floating IP") and the tools you might use to debug and fix these problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We'll have a lot of time for Q&amp;amp;A, and we will have OpenStack networking experts from Red Hat on-hand to help with those.&lt;/p&gt;
