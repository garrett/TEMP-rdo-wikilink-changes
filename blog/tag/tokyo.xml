    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;A week ago in Tokyo, we held the third RDO Community Meetup at the
OpenStack Summit. We had about 70 people in attendance, and some good
discussion. The full agenda for the meeting is at &lt;a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-tokyo"&gt;https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-tokyo&lt;/a&gt; and below are some of the things that were discussed. (The complete recording is at the bottom of this post.)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;People who were in attendance, please feel free to &lt;a href="https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/blob/master/source/blog/2015-11-04-community-meetup-at-openstack-tokyo.html.md"&gt;update and annote&lt;/a&gt; your section of this report if you wish to add detail, or if I get anything wrong.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We started with a discussion of how the project is governed. It was observed that although we have a &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-November/msg00028.html"&gt;weekly meeting&lt;/a&gt;, it's not always possible for everyone to attend, but that these meetings are summarized back to the mailing list each week.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We announced that the new RDO website is live (you're looking at it now!) and that it is possible to &lt;a href="https://github.com/rbowen/rdo-website"&gt;send pull requests&lt;/a&gt; for it now.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Haikel asked whether there was any interest in his project of an RDO aarch64 port, and identified a few people who expressed interest.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Trown talked a bit about the status of &lt;a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/rdo-manager/"&gt;RDO-Manager&lt;/a&gt; in Liberty. Liberty is the first release where RDO-Manager has released at the same time, which is a big step. He briefly discussed the RDO Manager quickstart that is being worked on. Check back here later for a link to Trown's more detailed writeup.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regarding the question of the relationship between RDO Manager and TripleO, it was established that RDO Manager is a downstream of TripleO, rather than being an upstream effort. It's more than just TripleO, but, rather, is a distribution of several tools, built on top of TripleO.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We spoke briefly about documenting what all of the moving pieces of the RDO project are, and how they fit together. Haikel said that he's made a start at documenting this, and drawing diagrams. He also encourage people to step up to participate in both documenting, and in improving the infrastructure.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A discussion arose about what the process is to get an upstream patch into RDO. From this, an &lt;a href="https://github.com/redhat-openstack/website/issues/213"&gt;action item&lt;/a&gt; was raised to more clearly document what the process is to request patches, and where to &lt;a href="https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=RDO"&gt;file tickets&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We discussed the timing and frequency of test days in the Mitaka cycle, and this was later discussed more on IRC. The consensus was that there should be a test day about a week after each milestone, with a sanity check done during that week so that we don't have a catastrophic test day. Now that the &lt;a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Mitaka_Release_Schedule"&gt;Mitaka release schedule is published&lt;/a&gt; we should be able to put together a tentative &lt;a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/"&gt;test day schedule&lt;/a&gt; very soon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;An overview was given of the &lt;a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Rpm-packaging"&gt;RPM packaging&lt;/a&gt; effort in upstream OpenStack.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The relationship with CentOS was discussed, in particular the manual process required to push packages up to the repos. This process still requires that we ping the CentOS admins, but this will soon be an automated process. Haikel also enumerated the various reasons that the relationship with CentOS is still of great benefit to RDO, including exposure to a wider audience due to CentOS's recognized name. There was also a view expressed that we should run an RDO-based cloud, perhaps in addition to the CentOS infrastructure, so that we are testing on our own platform.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, Rich Megginson spoke about the data aggregation effort that he is working on with Tushar Katarki. Rich has written &lt;a href="http://richmegginson.livejournal.com/27696.html"&gt;a more detailed writeup of that section&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, a quick announcement was made of the upcoming &lt;a href="https://www.redhat.com/archives/rdo-list/2015-November/msg00027.html"&gt;RDO Community Day at FOSDEM&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you'd like to hear more detail from the meetup, I've put the &lt;a href="http://drbacchus.com/podcasts/openstack/rdo_meetup_tokyo.mp3"&gt;complete recording&lt;/a&gt; up, and you can listen below. (59 minutes, 109 MB)&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>Vulnerability Management for OpenStack Mitaka cycle</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;Once again, OpenStack engineers met to design the Mitaka cycle.
Here is a summary of the &lt;a href="https://security.openstack.org"&gt;Security Project&lt;/a&gt;
and relevant release mangement changes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="what-is-the-openstack-security-project-"&gt;What is the OpenStack Security Project ?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Security issues, tooling, innovations and education within OpenStack are the responsibility of the Security Project.
The Security Project undertakes technical and governance activities for the OpenStack community,
aiming to provide guidance, information and code that enhances the OpenStack ecosystem's security.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="bandit-and-syntribos"&gt;Bandit and Syntribos&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The OSSP (OpenStack Security Project) discussed &lt;a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Security/Projects/Bandit"&gt;Bandit&lt;/a&gt;
and &lt;a href="http://git.openstack.org/cgit/openstack/syntribos"&gt;Syntribos&lt;/a&gt; developpements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Bandit is a static analyser for python language whose purpose is to find trivial programing
mistakes and to help enforce strong security guideline.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Syntribos is an API testing framework that aims to facilitate fault injection tests through REST
interfaces.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While Bandit is currently used as a gate job for Keystone, Syntribos is currently being developed
and its usecases are still under constructions.
Overall, roadmap's goals are to get better reporting from the tools, more OpenStack projects
on board and improved stability. Both etherpads used during design sessions are available here: &lt;a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/security-mitaka-worksession-bandit"&gt;Bandit worksession&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/security-mitaka-worksession-syntribos"&gt;Syntribos worksession&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="governance-tag-vulnerabilitymanaged"&gt;Governance Tag: vulnerability:managed&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The vulnerability management team &lt;a href="https://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html"&gt;VMT&lt;/a&gt; introduced a new tag &lt;a href="http://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/vulnerability_managed.html"&gt;vulnerability:managed&lt;/a&gt;
to help identify which projects are being supervised by the team.
The incubation process for new projects is now described &lt;a href="http://governance.openstack.org/reference/tags/vulnerability_managed.html#requirements"&gt;there&lt;/a&gt; and we are looking to have a few more project on board.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to help us scale for the big tent, a new downstream stakeholder mailing list will be
created to ease advanced notification workflow (pre-OSSAs).
This list would also be useful for projects that are not yet supported and to warn
stakeholders about upcoming vulnerabilities.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id="stable-release"&gt;Stable Release&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Stable releases such as 2015.1.2 are now gone and will no longer be produced.
Instead, projects will now be able to release new versions independly and security fixes should
be tagged and released right after their merge.
This is a great improvement for all upstream release users and stable release managers as the
process is now streamlined.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Other improvements for release management are to be expected, such as automation of release notes
with &lt;a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/reno/"&gt;reno&lt;/a&gt;, a
&lt;a href="https://www.openstack.org/software/project-navigator"&gt;project explorer&lt;/a&gt;
and a handy page of version numbers recap for the &lt;a href="http://docs.openstack.org/releases/releases/liberty.html"&gt;last release&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Once again, we have made great progress and I'm looking forward to further developments.
Thank you all for the great OpenStack Mitaka Design Summit!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tristan Cacqueray&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;OpenStack Vulnerability Management Team&lt;/p&gt;

    <title>What does RDO stand for?</title>

    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;What does RDO stand for?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt="tshirt" src="/images/blog/rdo-tshirt.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href="/rdo/faq"&gt;RDO FAQ&lt;/a&gt; has long said that RDO doesn't stand for
anything. This is a very unsatisfying answer to one of the most
frequently asked questions about RDO. So, a little while ago, I started
saying that RDO stands for "Rich's Distribution of OpenStack." Although
tongue-in-cheek, this response emphasizes that RDO is a community driven
project. So it's also Radez's Distribution of OpenStack, and Radhesh's and Russel's
and red_trela's. (As well as lots of people whose names don't start with R!)&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It also stands for "RPM Distribution of OpenStack." And "Really
Deploy OpenStack", and "Rebuilt Daily OpenStack", and a variety of other
things.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, that's the thinking behind the tshirt that we're giving out at our booth at
OpenStack Summit here in Tokyo. We still have a few left, so drop by the Red
Hat booth and get yours while they last.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Why ducks?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, as everyone knows, sometimes, the moment you ask a question
out loud, the obvious answer occurs to you. And often, when
explaining a problem to someone else, you understand it better
yourself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Red Hat has your back on this. We have ducks at our booth at OpenStack
Summit in Tokyo this week. The benefits of using a rubber duck as part
of your programming work flow are &lt;a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging"&gt;well
documented&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, come grab a duck, and learn more about RDO, in the OpenStack
Marketplace at &lt;a href="http://openstack.org/summit/"&gt;OpenStack Summit&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
