<p>Continuing my series of interviews with RDO engineers, here's my chat with Emilien Macchi, who I talked with at OpenStack Summit last week in Austin.</p>

<p>If you'd like to talk about what you did in Mitaka, please contact me at <a href="&#109;&#097;&#105;&#108;&#116;&#111;:&#114;&#098;&#111;&#119;&#101;&#110;&#064;&#114;&#101;&#100;&#104;&#097;&#116;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;">&#114;&#098;&#111;&#119;&#101;&#110;&#064;&#114;&#101;&#100;&#104;&#097;&#116;&#046;&#099;&#111;&#109;</a>.</p>

<p>(If the above player doesn't work for you, please download the audio <a href="https://rdocommunity.podbean.com/mf/play/uinm26/emilien_macchi.mp3">HERE</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rich</strong>: I'm speaking with Emilien Macchi, who is one of the people that
worked on the Mitaka release of OpenStack. Thank you for taking time
to speak with me.</p>

<p><strong>Emilien</strong>: Thank you for welcoming me.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: What did you do in Mitaka?</p>

<p><strong>E</strong>: In Mitaka, most of my tasks were related to packaging testing. I'm
currently leading the Puppet OpenStack group, which is a team where we
develop some Puppet modules that deploy OpenStack in production. Red
Hat is using the Puppet modules in TripleO, so we can automate the
deployment of OpenStack services. Recently we switched the gates of
OpenStack Infra to use RDO packaging. We had a lot of issued before
because we didn't have much CI. But since Mitaka, the RDO and the
Puppet teams worked a lot together to make sure that we can provide
some testing together. We can fix things very early when it's broken
upstream. Like when we have a new dependency or when we have a change
in the requirements. That was this kind of test where you provide very
early feedback to the RDO people that are doing the packaging. It was
very interesting to work with RDO.</p>

<p>We provided early feedback on the builds, on the failures. We also
contributed to … I say "we", I don't like to say "I" … we, my
group, my Puppet group, we contributed to the new packages that we
have in Mitaka. We updated the spec in the package so we could have
more features, and more services in the RDO projects.</p>

<p>Testing! Testing every day. Testing, testing, testing. Participating
in the events that the RDO community is having, like the weekly
meetings, the testing days. It was very interesting for us to have
this relationship with the RDO team.</p>

<p>So I'm looking forward to Newton.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: What do you anticipate you'll be working on in Newton?</p>

<p><strong>E</strong>: Well, that's an interesting question. We are talking about this
week. [At OpenStack Summit, Austin.]</p>

<p>The challenge for us … the biggest challenge, I guess, is to follow
the release velocity of upstream projects. We have a bunch of projects
in OpenStack, and it's very hard to catch up with all of the projects
at the same time. In the meantime we have to because those projects,
they are in the RDO project and also in the products, so that's
something we need to … we need to scale the way that we producing
all this work.</p>

<p>Something we are very focused on right now is to use the Software
Factory project, which is how OpenStack Infra is operating to build
OpenStack software. This is a project - an open source project - which
is now used by RDO. We can have this same way as upstream, but for
downstream - we can have the same way to produce the RDO artifacts,
like the packages and the Puppet modules, and so on. That's the next
big challenge, is to be fully integrated with Software Factory, to
implement the missing features we will need to make the testing
better.</p>

<p>Yeah, that's the biggest challenge: Improve the testing, and stopping
doing manual things, automate all the things, that is the next
challenge.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Thank you very much. Thanks for your time.</p>

<p><strong>E</strong>: Thank you for your time.</p>

<p>After releasing RDO Mitaka, we migrated our current packaging workflow from gerrithub to a brand-new platform hosted at  <a href="https://review.rdoproject.org">https://review.rdoproject.org</a> right before the Newton Summit.
During the last cycle, we've worked with <a href="https://software-factory.io">Software Factory</a> folks to build a new packaging workflow based on the very same foundations as upstream OpenStack (using gerrit, zuul, nodepool). We're now relying on RPMFactory which is a specialization of Software Factory fitted for RPM packaging needs.</p>

<p>The migration was planned in order to satisfy some criteria:</p>

<ul>
  <li>providing a consistent user experience to RDO contributors</li>
  <li>simplify and streamline our workflow</li>
  <li>consolidate resources</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="workflow-changes">Workflow changes</h3>

<p>So now, packages are maintained through <a href="https://review.rdoproject.org">https://review.rdoproject.org</a>
and packages dist-git are replicated to the <a href="https://github.com/rdo-packages">rdo-packages</a> github organization.
The rdopkg utility has been updated to support the new workflow with new
commands: clone, review-patch and review-spec.</p>

<p>Anyone can submit changes for the review, which can be approved by the following groups:</p>

<ul>
  <li>rdo-provenpackager much like Fedora provenpackagers can +2 and +W changes for all projects.</li>
  <li>PROJECT-core: package maintainers listed in rdoinfo can +2 and +W
changes for their projects.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="howto">Howto</h3>

<p>We're working to refresh documentation, but here's a short howto to hack
on packaging:</p>

<ol>
  <li>dnf copr enable jruzicka/rdopkg &amp;&amp; dnf install -y rdopkg</li>
  <li>rdopkg clone <mypackage> [-u <githubuser>]  This will create the following remotes
</githubuser></mypackage>    <ul>
      <li>origin: dist-git</li>
      <li>patches: upstream sources at current package version</li>
      <li>upstream: upstream sources</li>
      <li>review-origin: used to interact with RPMFactory</li>
      <li>review-patches: used to interact with RPMFactory</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>modify packaging</li>
  <li>rdopkg review-spec</li>
  <li>review then merge</li>
</ol>

<p>For downstream patches, the workflow is a bit different as we don't
merge patches but keep reviews open in order to keep the whole patch
chain history.
rdopkg has been updated to behave properly in that aspect.</p>

<p>We still have improvements coming but no major changes to this workflow,
if you have any questions, feel free to ping us on irc (#rdo @freenode)
or the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list">mailing list</a>.</p>

<p>Regards,
The RDO Eng. team</p>

<p>Before releasing Mitaka, we agreed on a tecnical definition of done<a href="https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/rdo/2016-04-06/rdo_meeting_%282016-04-06%29.2016-04-06-15.00.log.html#l-269">1</a>. This can always evolve to add more coverage, but this is what we currently test when deciding whether a release is ready from a technical perspective:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Packstack all-in-one deployments testing the 3 upstream scenarios</li>
  <li>TripleO single contoller and single compute deployment validated with Tempest smoke tests</li>
  <li>TripleO three controller and single compute deployment with pacemaker validated using a Heat template based ping test</li>
</ul>

<p>These same tests are used to validate our trunk repos<a href="https://ci.centos.org/view/rdo/view/promotion-pipeline/">2</a>.</p>

<p>OpenStack engineers met in Austin last week to design the Newton cycle.
Here is a report for the <a href="https://security.openstack.org">Security Project</a>
and other associated efforts.</p>

<h2 id="requirements-for-the-vulnerabilitymanaged-governance-tag">Requirements for the vulnerability:managed governance tag</h2>

<p>During Mitaka, the vulnerability management team ("VMT") introduced a new
vulnerability:managed tag to help identify supported projects.
In essence, this tag indicates that a project's security bug reports are triaged by the VMT
<a href="http://security.openstack.org/vmt-process.html#incident-report-taxonomy">taxonomy</a>.
For class A reports, the VMT issues an OpenStack Security Advisory ("OSSA").</p>

<p>The VMT documented a set of requirements to get the tag:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Deliverable repositories,</li>
  <li>Dedicated point of contact, usualy a subset of the core team called coresec,</li>
  <li>PTL agrees to act as a VMT liaison to escalate severe issues,</li>
  <li>Bug tracker reconfiguration, and</li>
  <li>Third-party review/audit/threat analysis.</li>
</ul>

<p>The last point (item 5) intends to ensure that the VMT doesn't become a
bottleneck for projects with poor security practices or that have unknown
fundamental flaws.
By design, the VMT is a small team, composed of 3 volunteers.
Thus, new projects must demonstrate that they won't cause an unmanageable
number of security bug reports.</p>

<p>In the next section, I will set-out how we can efficiently increase the
number of vulnerability:managed projects as designed during the Newton summit
<a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/security-newton-summit-threatanalysis">etherpad</a>.</p>

<h2 id="what-vmt-members-need-to-know">What VMT members need to know</h2>

<p>Since day 1, doing VMT work for OpenStack has been a challenging task due to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>A wide attack surface,</li>
  <li>Source code and api version changes,</li>
  <li>Deployment modes with distinct threats, and</li>
  <li>Coordination between different communities.</li>
</ul>

<p>Here is the list of questions that need to be answered when managing a new
project:</p>

<ul>
  <li>What are the input data formats and how are they processed ?</li>
  <li>Which actions are restricted to operators ?</li>
  <li>What has been considered a vulnerability in previous bug reports ?</li>
  <li>What can a malicious user do depends on:
    <ul>
      <li>Available services, including the non-obvious ones, such as nova-novncproxy,</li>
      <li>API endpoint paths, including old versions, such as glance v1, and</li>
      <li>Every other network-facing service to which a user can connect.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>A document answering the above questions will likely be required for any
vulnerability:managed tag application.
Moreover, already supported projects will also need to validate the above
requirements in order to keep the tag.</p>

<p>This document needs to be maintained within the OpenStack community using
open code review. The <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/sec/">security-guide</a> or
project documentation are appropriate locations to publish it.</p>

<p>Here is the proposed
<a href="http://openstack-security.github.io/collaboration/2016/04/26/threat-analysis-process.html">threat analysis process</a>
and
<a href="http://openstack-security.github.io/threatanalysis/2016/02/07/anchorTA.html">Anchor</a>'s
threat analysis.</p>

<h2 id="stable-release">Stable Release</h2>

<p>Major changes to the OpenStack release process were introduced last cycles:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Integrated releases, such as 2015.1.2 are now gone,</li>
  <li>Projects may use different release models,</li>
  <li>Unified versions numbers <a href="http://semver.org">semver</a>, and</li>
  <li>Automated publication to <a href="http://releases.openstack.org/">website</a>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The "stable summit" set new goals for the Newton cycle:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Increase stable release support to 18 months with an option for 6 additional
months,</li>
  <li>Backwards compatibility for libraries, and</li>
  <li>Co-installability requirements.</li>
</ul>

<p>End of life policy is the most important topic for the VMT since it increases
the number of supported branchs. Infra and QA are also directly affected since
they have to maintain the CI capacity for supported stable releases. While in
theory it's possible to extend support, here is a list of practical blockers to
be addressed:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Stable branch gates break too often, see
<a href="http://status.openstack.org/openstack-health/#/g/build_queue/periodic-stable">openstack-health</a>,</li>
  <li>Backport to old releases is time consuming when the affected code went
through several refactors, and</li>
  <li>Long Term Stable (LTS) versions aren't an option because upgrade process
must deploy each versions.</li>
</ul>

<p>In summary, Kilo release end of life won't be extended and the branch will
likely be closed soon, EOL: 2016-05-02. Further, external dependencies
requirements are not supported by the VMT, but it is worth noting that a new
Requirement Team will be created to manage this increasingly difficult
situation.</p>

<p>More details in those two etherpads:
<a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/stable-branch-eol-policy-newton">eol-policy</a>
and
<a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/newton-stable-summit">stable summit</a></p>

<h2 id="issue-tracker">Issue tracker</h2>

<p>Last but not least, there was a
<a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/newton-infra-community-task-tracking">design session</a>
to discuss issue tracker for OpenStack projects. This is a critical topic for
vulnerability management since most VMT work actually happens on the issue
tracker.</p>

<p>OpenStack projects currently use launchpad.net to track issues and write
blueprints for feature tracking. The workflow being sub-optimal, there is an
on-going effort to replace launchpad by something better. Migration issues
aside, the real concern is that we may end up with another sub-optimal solution
which doesn't justify the migration cost.</p>

<p>On the other hand, the OpenStack community initiated
<a href="https://storyboard.openstack.org">storyboard</a> which is designed to address
the exceptional needs of OpenStack development. Unfortunately, the project
stalled due to the lack of reviewers.</p>

<p>The OpenStack community has three main options regarding issue tracking:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Develop its own issue tracker (e.g. storyboard),</li>
  <li>Operate a ready-to-use solution (e.g. maniphest), or</li>
  <li>Use an external service (e.g. launchpad).</li>
</ul>

<p>This topic will be discussed in the following weeks.
Hopefully it will lead to a long term decision from the TC with Infra
approval.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Once again, we have made great progress and I'm looking forward to further
developments.
Thank you all for the great OpenStack Newton Design Summit!</p>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon about 60 people gathered for the RDO BoF (Birds of a Feather) session at OpenStack Summit in Austin.</p>

<p><em>By the way, the term Birds of a Feather comes from the saying "Birds of a feather flock together", which refers to like-minded people gathering.</em></p>

<p>The topics discussed can be found in the <a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-austin-bof">agenda</a>.</p>

<p>The network was friendly, and we managed to capture the whole session in a Google Hangout. The video of the session is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pmb3RA1GmGs">HERE</a>.</p>

<p>And there are several pictures from the event on the <a href="https://plus.google.com/communities/110409030763231732154">RDO Google+ page</a>.</p>

<p>Thank you for all who attended. You'll see follow-up discussion on a number of the topics discussed on <a href="https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list">rdo-list</a> over the coming weeks.</p>

<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Today I'm speaking with Javier Peña, who is another member
of the Red Hat OpenStack engineering team. Thanks for making time to
speak with me.</p>

<p><strong>Javier</strong>: Thank you very much for inviting me, Rich.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: What did you work on in the Mitaka cycle?</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: I've been focusing on three main topics. First one was keeping the
DLRN infrastructure up and running. As you know, this is the service
we use to create RPM packages for our RDO distribution, straight from
the upstream master commits.</p>

<p>It's been evolving quite a lot during this cycle. We ended up with so
much success that we're having infrastructure issues. One of the
topics for the next cycle will be to improve the infrastructure, but
that's something we'll talk about later.</p>

<p>These packages have now been consumed by the TripleO, Kolla, and
Puppet OpenStack CI, so we're quite well tested. Not only are we
testing them directly from the RDO trunk repositories, but we have
external trials as well.</p>

<p>On top of that I have also been working on packaging, just like some
other colleagues on the team who've you've already had a chance to
talk to - Haikel, Chandan - I have been contributing packages both to
upstream Fedora, and also RDO directly.</p>

<p>And finally, I'm also one of the core maintainers of Packstack. In
this cycle we've been adding support for some services such as AODH
and Gnocchi. Also we switched Mysql support from the Python side. We
switched libraries, and we had to do some work with the upstream
Puppet community to make sure that PyMysql, which is now the default
Python library used upstream, is also used inside the Puppet core and
we can use it in Packstack.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: You mentioned briefly infrastructure changes that you'll be making
in the upcoming cycle. Can you tell us more about what you have
planned for Newton?</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: Right now the DLRN infrastructure is building 6 different lines of
repositories. We have CentOS master, which is now Newton. Mitaka,
Liberty, and Kilo. And we have two branches for Fedora as well. So
this is quite a heavy load for VMs that we're running right now. We
were having some issues in the cloud we were running that instance. So
what we're doing now is we are migrating to the CentOS CI
infrastructure. We are having a much bigger machine in there. And also
what we are going to do is we will be publishing the resulting
repositories using the CentOS CDN, which is way more reliable than
what we could build with individual VMs.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Thank you again for your time. And we look forward to seeing what
comes in Newton.</p>

<p><strong>J</strong>: Thank you very much, Rich.</p>

<p>In this installment of the "What Did You Do in Mitaka" series, I'm
speaking with Haïkel Guémar</p>

<iframe id="audio_iframe" src="https://www.podbean.com/media/player/z8zks-5ea7c6?from=yiiadmin" data-link="http://www.podbean.com/media/player/z8zks-5ea7c6?from=yiiadmin" height="100" width="100%" frameborder="0" scrolling="no" data-name="pb-iframe-player"></iframe>

<p>(If the above player doesn't work for you, you can download the audio <a href="https://rdocommunity.podbean.com/mf/play/pfcayj/haikel-guemar-mitaka.mp/">HERE</a>.)</p>

<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Thanks for making time to speak with me.</p>

<p><strong>Haïkel</strong>: Thank you.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: So, tell me, what did you do in Mitaka?</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: I work on the <a href="http://rdoproject.org">RDO</a> engineering team - the team that is responsible
for the stewardship of RDO. For this cycle, I've been focusing on our
new packaging work flow.</p>

<p>We were using, for a long time, a piece of infrastructure taken from
Fedora, CentOS, and GitHub. This didn't work very well, and was not
providing a consistent experience for the contributors. So we've been
working with another team at Red Hat to provide a more integrated
platform, and one that mirrors the one that we have upstream, based on
the same tools - meaning Git, Gerrit, Jenkins, Nodepool, Zuul - that is
called <a href="https://github.com/redhat-cip/software-factory">Software Factory</a>. So we've been working with the Software
Factory team to provide a specialization of that platform called
<a href="https://github.com/redhat-cip/rpmfactory">RPMFactory</a>.</p>

<p>RPMFactory is a platform specialized for producing RPMs in a
continuous delivery fashion. It has all the advantages of the old
tooling we have been using, but with more consistency. You don't have
to look in different places to find the source code, the packaging,
and stuff like that. Everything is under a single portal.</p>

<p>That's what I've been focusing on during this cycle, on top of my
usual duties, which is producing packages and fixing it.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: And looking forward to the Newton release, what do you think you're
going to be working on in that cycle?</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: While we've been working in the new workflow, we've been setting a
new goal, that is to decrease the gap between upstream releases and
RDO releases down to 2 weeks. Well, we did it <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/rdo-mitaka-released/">on the very same day</a> for
Mitaka! So my goal would be for Newton to do as good as this time, or
even better. Why not under 2 hours? Not putting on ourselves more
pressure, but to try to release almost at the same time as upstream
GA, RDO. And also with the same quality standards.</p>

<p>One of the few things that I was not happy with during the Mitaka
cycle was mostly the fact that we didn't manage to release some
packages in time, so I'd like to do better. Soon enough I will be
asking for people to fill in a wish list on packaging, so that we are
able to work on that earlier. And so we could release them on time
with GA.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Thanks again for taking the time to do this.</p>

<p><strong>H</strong>: Thank you Rich, for the series.</p>

<p>Next in our series of "What Did You Do In Mitaka" articles, I spoke with Chandan Kumar, who works on packaging for RDO, and also is active on the mailing list and on IRC.</p>

<p><strong>Rich</strong>: RDO Mitaka was released <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/rdo-mitaka-released/">a little over a week ago</a>. I'm speaking with
Chandan Kumar, who is one of the people who is very active in the RDO
community. Thanks for taking time to speak with me.</p>

<p>Could you tell me what you did during the Mitaka cycle?</p>

<p><strong>Chandan</strong>: Thank you Rich.</p>

<p>Well, this release, I was packaging and reviewing RDO packages,
mostly. In the start of the Mitaka release I was tracking upstream
global requirements, and found some of the packages missing from the
RDO packages. So I maintained and packaged them.</p>

<p>In the list of packages are: python-wsgi_intercept, python-reno,
python-tosca-parser, python-weakrefmethod,
python-XStatic-roboto-fontface and many more in which
Python reno is most popular because it was used for adding and
deleting release notes to upstream OpenStack projects.</p>

<p>In the midcycle, I got a chance to work with Matthew from CERN. And at
the same time I had just completed packaging Python Magum client, and
helped in packaging Magnum for RDO</p>

<p>I also worked with Javier, Alan, and Haikel, in porting spec files of
Oslo libraries and its dependencies to Python 2 and Python 3 packages.
At that time there is a need of RDO specific spec templates for client
OpenStack test and Oslo libraries. That we have added.</p>

<p>Let's now come to the end of the Mitaka release. We have created
Python OpenStack services tests sub -package for all OpenStack
packages present in RDO. That was consumed by Puppet OpenStack CI,
and that was a great achievement for me.</p>

<p>And lastly, I have done code contributions and documentation changes
for <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/blog/2016/04/naming-is-hard-or-who-let-the-vowels-out/">DLRN</a>.</p>

<p>That was an exciting release in RDO land.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Do you expect to continue participating at the same level in the
Newton cycle?</p>

<p><strong>C</strong>: Yes. Since the Newton cycle has just started, Magnum trunk DLRN
builds got failed because of missing packages Python k8sclient. That I
have packaged, and imported, with the help of Alan, do DLRN. Now
it's working fine.</p>

<p>I will continue to do packaging and code contributions to rdopkg and
DLRN. Apart from that, I will continue to contribute to packstack
OpenStack module, and try to add new OpenStack services to RDO
ecosystem.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Thank you very much for taking time to speak with me.</p>

<p><strong>C</strong>: Thanks, Rich.</p>

<p>This has been a big few weeks for RDO, and for OpenStack in general, with the Mitaka release coming out, and OpenStack Summit just around the corner.</p>

<p>Here's some of what RDO enthusiasts have been blogging about in the last few days.</p>

<p><strong>RDO Mitaka released</strong> by Rich Bowen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The RDO community is pleased to announce the general availability of the RDO build for OpenStack Mitaka for RPM-based distributions - CentOS Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. RDO is suitable for building private, public, and hybrid clouds and Mitaka is the 13th release from the OpenStack project, which is the work of more than 2500 contributors from around the world.</p>

<p><strong>What, Why, and How is the CentOS Cloud SIG?</strong> by Rich Bowen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>2 years ago we started the CentOS Cloud SIG. Progress has been slow but steady. Slow, I think, because we've not done a wonderful job of explaining what it's for, and why it matters. But it has been a very important aspect of moving the RDO project forward, so it deserves better explanation.</p>

<p><strong>Naming is hard or Who Let The Vowels Out</strong> by Alan Pevec</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When Derek Higgins started the tool to build OpenStack packages based on latest upstream aka "trunk" changes, the name Delorean seemed like a good choice: the tool is keeping older builds so you could "go back in time" like with a time machine, it's geeky enough and there's Irish connection.</p>

<p><strong>Integrating OpenStack into the Enterprise</strong> by Michael Solberg</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Adoption of OpenStack in the enterprise has been progressing steadily over the last two years. As a Forrester Report* on enterprise adoption from September noted, “OpenStack demonstrates the completeness, robustness, and capability upon which a broader range of adopters can depend.” OpenStack deployments have proven to be complex in larger IT organizations though, but not because of the reasons that you might anticipate. Much has been made about the complexity of installing the software, but we’ve found that the lion’s share of effort in these implementation comes around the practice of integrating IaaS into the fabric of enterprise IT and evolving existing processes to meet the expectations of the user community.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Started with Puppet for Keystone</strong> by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Tripleo uses Puppet to manage the resources in a deployment. Puppet has a command line tool to look at resources.</p>

<p><strong>What did you do in Mitaka? : Ivan Chavero</strong> by Rich Bowen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The OpenStack cloud software project recently released the Mitaka release. RDO is a community distribution of OpenStack. I've invited several of the engineers that work on RDO to talk about what they did in the Mitaka cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Learning something new about Oslo Versioned Objects</strong> byGorka Eguileor</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you work on an OpenStack project that is in the process of adopting Versioned Objects or has recently adopted them, like we have in Cinder, you’ve probably done some code reviews, and even implemented a couple of Versioned Objects yourself, and are probably thinking that you know your way around them pretty well, but maybe there are some gaps in that knowledge that you are not aware of, specially if you are taking Nova’s or Cinder’s code as reference, at least I know I had some gaps. If you aren’t a seasoned Versioned Object user like the Nova people are, I recommend you keep reading.</p>

<p><strong>TripleO with already deployed servers</strong> by James Slagle</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Recently I’ve been prototyping how to use TripleO with already deployed
and provisioned servers. In such a scenario, Nova and Ironic would not be used
to do the initial operating system provisioning of the Overcloud nodes.
Instead, the nodes would already be powered on, running an OS, and ready to
start to configure OpenStack.</p>

<p>2 years ago we started the <a href="https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud">CentOS Cloud SIG</a>. Progress has been slow but steady. Slow, I think, because we've not done a wonderful job of explaining what it's for, and why it matters. But it has been a very important aspect of moving the <a href="http://rdoproject.org/">RDO project</a> forward, so it deserves better explanation.</p>

<p>The Cloud SIG produces packages which allow you, the CentOS user, to deploy Cloud infrastructure on top of CentOS with complete confidence that it's going to work.</p>

<p>So, it's more than just packages - the RDO project was already producing packages. It's the entire ecosystem, testing OpenStack (and other cloud platforms) on CentOS, ensuring that OpenStack will work on CentOS, and that CentOS will work on OpenStack. To this end, there's <a href="https://ci.centos.org/">CI on the CentOS infrastructure</a>, which is also used by numerous other projects, so we know that what we're doing doesn't break what they're doing.</p>

<p>It's also a community of cloud operators, running on CentOS, providing support to other users, and feedback and bug reports to the developers working upstream. This feedback loop further ensures the reliability of the platform, not only for CentOS users, but for the entire OpenStack community.</p>

<p>We meet every Thursday at 15:00 UTC on the #centos-devel channel on Freenode IRC, if you want to drop by and have your say. If you're using CentOS, and you're deploying any cloud infrastructure, we want to hear from you.</p>
