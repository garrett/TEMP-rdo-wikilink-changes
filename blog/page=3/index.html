<p>In this installment of our "What did you do in Mitaka?" series, Ihar Hrachyshka talks about his work on Neutron both in Mitaka, and what's planned for Newton.</p>

<p>You can listen below. If the player doesn't work for you, you can listen <a href="http://rdocommunity.podbean.com/mf/web/sipki2/ihar_hrachyshka_mitaka.mp3/">HERE</a>.</p>

<iframe id="audio_iframe" src="https://www.podbean.com/media/player/7ximn-5e7230" width="100%" height="100" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Hello, I'm speaking with <a href="http://tm3.org/64">Ihar Hrachyshka</a> about the work that he did
in the RDO community on the <a href="http://releases.openstack.org/mitaka/index.html">Mitaka release of OpenStack</a>. Thank you for
taking time to speak with me.</p>

<p><strong>Ihar</strong>: Thank you for having me</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Could you mention the things that you've worked on in Mitaka, both
upstream, and also specifically for <a href="http://rdoproject.org">RDO</a>.</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>: One thing that I was focusing on during Mitaka in upstream is - we
are looking at how we can enhance the upgrade story for the project I
work on, which is <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Neutron">Neutron</a>.</p>

<p>(See <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/releasenotes/neutron/mitaka.html">Neutron Mitaka release notes</a>  )</p>

<p>There was a lot of good work done in this regard on other projects, in
previous cycles, like in Nova. And Neutron was kind of lagging on
that. During Mitaka, we formed a sub-team that looks specifically into
the upgrade story, and we've identified several pain points that we
were addressing during this cycle, and plan to continue the work in
Neutron, and forward.</p>

<p>One thing that we've identified is even though so-called rolling
upgrades were kind of supported in the sense that there was some code
to handle that scenario, for upgrades. But it was never actually
validated in our CI gate, so no-one could be sure that it actually
worked. So that was one thing that we tackled. We added proper jobs to
validate these scenarios, and make sure that they work.</p>

<p>Another thing for upgrades is that we are looking at reducing and
maybe even eliminating any downtime for API endpoints for Neutron,
especially in the case when you have highly-available controllers. That
involves a lot of work in the code base, a lot of change there to
refactor the code. We've already started the work during Mitaka, and
we're going to proceed with that in Newton. We hope that we complete
this work in Newton, and then for all upgrades starting from Newton to
the next release, operators will be able to retain their Neutron API
available while controllers are upgraded one by one. That's one thing
that I was working on.</p>

<p>There are other things. There was a lot of work done in Neutron in the
scope of Quality of Service (QOS). The initial support for QOS in
Neutron was merged in Liberty, but it's still quite limited, so we
expand on what we had done in that release. Specifically, the initial
support was just for OpenVSwitch, but in Mitaka we added support for
Linuxbridge ml2 driver. We also added role-based access control for QOS
policies. We added support for so-called DSCP tags, which is a feature
to prioritize traffic based on which port it came from.</p>

<p>Another interesting thing that we finally tackled in Mitaka is MTU
support. This is one of the huge pain points that were identified
by operators in the past, that Neutron, while being the networking
solution for OpenStack, cannot actually properly handle MTUs - which
stands for Maximum Transfer Unit. Neutron could not actually handle,
neither standard MTUs for ethernet, nor so-called jumbo frames, which
is really bad. It means that instances did not have access to the full
capabilities of the underlying physical infrastructure. That should
hopefully go away in Mitaka, because there were several changes there,
both on the Neutron side, and on Nova, which now should make Neutron
work out of the box, both for non-standard and standard MTU sizes.</p>

<p>Finally, one thing to note, apart from pure upstream work in the
Master branch, is that in Neutron, in this Mitaka release, we adopted
a new approach to handle backports for stable branches. Now instead of
waiting for something to break in a user installation, and then
reacting to their bug reports, we are proactively backporting all of
the bug fixes from the latest master branch into stable branches, and
release new stable releases, often. We hope that it will reduce the
number of painful problems, in actual installations that rely on stable
branches, very significantly.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: This sounds like an enormous amount of work. How many people are
you working with across how many organizations, would you estimate?</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>: In OpenStack it's always that you work with other people. I would
say … I don't know … there are I think 5, 6, major contributors to
Neutron. Surely, nothing comes in OpenStack if you're just single. So
that's collaboration.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Thank you very much for your time, and we look forward to seeing
what comes in Newton.</p>

<p>I: Thank you.</p>

<p><em>This is the first in what will hopefully be a long series of interviews with OpenStack engineers about what they worked on in the Mitaka cycle.</em></p>

<p>The <a href="http://openstack.org/">OpenStack</a>  cloud software project recently released the <a href="http://releases.openstack.org/mitaka/index.html">Mitaka
release</a>. 
<a href="http://rdoproject.org/">RDO</a> is a community distribution of OpenStack. I've invited
several of the engineers that work on RDO to talk about what they did
in the Mitaka cycle.</p>

<iframe id="audio_iframe" src="https://www.podbean.com/media/player/spvip-5e6b58" width="100%" height="100" frameborder="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

<p>If the above player doesn't appear, or doesn't work for you, you can listen <a href="http://rdocommunity.podbean.com/mf/play/urpzjr/ivan_chavero_packstack.mp3">here</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Rich</strong>: Mitaka is ready now, and before we move on to Newton, we should
celebrate what we've done in Mitaka. I'm speaking with <a href="http://tm3.org/63">Ivan
Chavero</a>. I
understand that you worked primarily on <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Packstack">packstack</a>. I've had to
correct a number of people over the last few months who think that
packstack is abandoned, and we're not doing it any more. While, at the
same time, the people at <a href="www.cern.ch">CERN</a> use packstack for a lot of things. and I
know that they're an unusual case, but there are other people that are
using it.</p>

<p>Tell us what you did in the Mitaka cycle.</p>

<p><strong>Ivan</strong>: Well, we fixed a lot of bugs. We had a lot of problems because
there was some <a href="http://docs.openstack.org/developer/keystone/http-api.html#should-i-use-v2-0-or-v3">migration from Keystone version 2 to Keystone version 3</a>.
We added some other components like, <a href="http://superuser.openstack.org/articles/ceilometer-gnocchi-and-aodh-liberty-progress">Ceilometer was split into aodh
and Gnocci</a>, and we added that stuff.</p>

<p>I think it's pretty stable right now.</p>

<p>We added more features to
Neutron. Everything we have to … the new stuff, we have to test. We
add it to Packstack.</p>

<p>I wanted to add <a href="https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Magnum">Magnum</a>, but it wasn't a priority. And there's other
stuff like <a href="http://ceph.com/">Ceph</a> that we wanted to add, but it was just like, let's fix
bugs, let's fix the stuff we need, and keep Packstack stable.</p>

<p>We did a lot of bug fixes for Packstack being able to work properly
with the CI infrastructure. Pretty much fixing a lot of bugs that we
found on the road.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Some of those other things that you mentioned - Magnum and Ceph and
so on, are those going to be goals for the Newton cycle, then?</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>: Well, I want them to be goals, but I have to discuss it with the
community.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Who else in the community is working on Packstack?</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>: There's a lot of people. In this cycle we had a lot of
contributions from outside the RDO community, which was very positive.
<a href="http://stackalytics.com/report/users/jpena-c">Javier Peña</a> is working
on that. <a href="http://stackalytics.com/report/users/dmsimard">David Simard</a>
is working on that from the CI part, a lot of stuff. <a href="http://stackalytics.com/report/users/apevec">Alan
Pevec</a> is our
guiding light. And <a href="http://stackalytics.com/report/users/mmagr">Martin
Mágr</a>,
who is the current PTL - he's stepping down but right now he's the
PTL. A lot of people that are always asking stuff about Packstack and
doing reviews, and actually submitting patches.</p>

<p>You know, I think that people think that Packstack is dead because
it's not recommended for production use. Only if you really know what
you're doing, you should use it in production, but it's not
recommended. <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo/">TripleO</a> is the recommended stuff for production, and
Packstack is for doing the experiments, and proof-of-concept stuff.</p>

<p>But I use it on my home OpenStack deployment, and I do a lot of
experiments. It's pretty good for experimenting, because it's pretty
lightweight, and it's very easy to modify.</p>

<p><strong>R</strong>: Thank you very much for your time, and I look forward to what's
coming in Newton!</p>

<p><strong>I</strong>: Thank you!</p>

<p>When <a href="http://www.openstack.org/blog/2014/02/open-mic-spotlight-derek-higgins/">Derek Higgins</a> started the <a href="https://github.com/openstack-packages/DLRN/commit/496baa4eb177873ba1421c6fbd7cc7041bd584a4">tool</a> to build OpenStack packages based on latest upstream aka "trunk" changes, the name Delorean seemed like a good choice: the tool is keeping older builds so you could "go back in time" like with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_time_machine">time machine</a>, it's geeky enough and there's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_Motor_Company#Manufacturing_facility">Irish connection</a>.</p>

<p>Fast forward earlier this year, when this tool is used and maintained by the <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/community/">RDO team</a> to build <a href="https://trunk.rdoproject.org/">RDO trunk</a> repositories, it was felt the time is right for the first release. And here is the first lesson when naming a (Python) project: check that name is available in <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi">PyPI</a> and reserve it! Unfortunately, it turned that name Delorean was already <a href="https://pypi.python.org/pypi/Delorean">taken by another project</a>. Next, lesson two: check if there is an active company using that name to avoid any possibility of trademark issues! In this case, a new company <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DeLorean_Motor_Company#Today">got rights for the original DMC (TM)</a>.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/community/community-meeting/">RDO community meeting</a> we decided to start collecting new name proposals and came up with the <a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/RDO-Delorean-rename">list</a> more or less in the same time travel and BTTF theme. The first proposal was <a href="https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Condensador_de_flujo">fluzo</a> by our Spanish-speaking folks but that was dismissed after finding out there is a company with exactly that name! Next was OUTATIME, the DeLorean time machine's license plate text, but there's actually a real movie with that name coming soon, so it was discarded to avoid confusion and possible trademark issues. Finally, staying with the license plate idea, DLRN was chosen: written as DLRN but you can read it Delorean.</p>

<p>The RDO community has already started work towards replacing mentions of "Delorean" in documentation, websites, code, and repositories. As a special case references mentioning "Delorean repository" will be renamed as "RDO trunk repository" to better describe the content.</p>

<p>P.S. The answer to the question in the title is dprince! <a href="https://meetbot.fedoraproject.org/rdo/2016-03-09/rdo_meeting_%282016-03-09%29.2016-03-09-15.01.log.html#l-141">1</a></p>

<p>The RDO community is pleased to announce the general availability of the RDO build for OpenStack Mitaka for RPM-based distributions - CentOS Linux 7 and Red Hat Enterprise Linux. RDO is suitable for building private, public, and hybrid clouds and Mitaka is the 13th release from the <a href="http://openstack.org">OpenStack project</a>, which is the work of more than 2500 contributors from around the world. 
(<a href="http://stackalytics.com/">Source</a>)</p>

<p>See <a href="http://redhatstackblog.redhat.com/2016/03/21/learn-whats-coming-in-openstack-mitaka/">RedHatStack</a> for a brief overview of what's new in Mitaka.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/">RDO community project</a> curates, packages, builds, tests, and maintains a complete OpenStack component set for RHEL and CentOS Linux and is a founding member of the <a href="https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud">CentOS Cloud Infrastructure SIG</a>. The Cloud Infrastructure SIG focuses on delivering a great user experience for CentOS Linux users looking to build and maintain their own on-premise, public or hybrid clouds.</p>

<p>All work on RDO, and on the downstream release, Red Hat OpenStack Platform, is 100% open source, with all code changes going upstream first.</p>

<p>For a complete list of what's in RDO, see <a href="https://github.com/redhat-openstack/rdoinfo/blob/master/rdo.yml">the RDO projects yaml file</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Started</strong></p>

<p>There are three ways to get started with RDO.</p>

<p>To spin up a proof of concept cloud, quickly, and on limited hardware, try the <a href="http://rdoproject.org/Quickstart">RDO QuickStart</a>  You can run RDO on a single node to get a feel for how it works.</p>

<p>For a production deployment of RDO, use the <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/tripleo/">TripleO Quickstart</a> and you'll be running a production cloud in short order.</p>

<p>Finally, if you want to try out OpenStack, but don't have the time or hardware to run it yourself, visit <a href="http://trystack.org/">TryStack</a>, where you can use a free public OpenStack instance, running RDO packages, to experiment with the OpenStack management interface and API, launch instances, configure networks, and generally familiarize yourself with OpenStack</p>

<p><strong>Getting Help</strong></p>

<p>The RDO Project participates in a Q&amp;A service at <a href="http://ask.openstack.org">ask.openstack.org</a>, for more developer oriented content we recommend joining the <a href="https://www.redhat.com/mailman/listinfo/rdo-list">rdo-list mailing list</a>. Remember to post a brief introduction about yourself and your RDO story. You can also find extensive documentation on the <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/documentation">RDO docs site</a>.</p>

<p>We also welcome comments and requests on the <a href="https://lists.centos.org/">CentOS Mailing lists</a> and the CentOS IRC Channels (#centos on irc.freenode.net), however we have a more focused audience in the RDO venues.</p>

<p><strong>Getting Involved</strong></p>

<p>To get involved in the OpenStack RPM packaging effort, see the <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/community/">RDO community pages</a> and the <a href="https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Cloud">CentOS Cloud SIG page</a>. See also the <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/packaging/">RDO packaging documentation</a>.</p>

<p>Join us in #rdo on the Freenode IRC network, and follow us at <a href="http://twitter.com/rdocommunity">@RDOCommunity</a> on Twitter.</p>

<p>And, if you're going to be in Austin for the <a href="http://openstack.org/summit/">OpenStack Summit</a> two weeks from now, join us on Thursday at 4:40pm for the <a href="https://goo.gl/P6kyWR">RDO community BoF</a>.</p>

<p>Here's what RDO enthusiasts were blogging about this week:</p>

<p><strong>St. Louis OpenStack Meetup</strong> by Rich Bowen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>On Tuesday evening I had the privilege of addressing the St. Louis OpenStack Meetup group. I gave an Introduction to OpenStack presentation to about 30 attendees, many of whom were indeed OpenStack beginners, or just beginning to research what this OpenStack thing is all about.</p>

<p><strong>Upcoming events in OpenStack and RDO</strong> by Rich Bowen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I love this time of year - the energy and passion that swells right around an upstream OpenStack release, and the weeks before an OpenStack Summit. Most of the year, people are heads down working on their particular part of the project, but as we near a release, there's a lot of interest in what's going on in the larger upstream.</p>

<p><strong>Extending OpenStack Disaster Recovery to Google Cloud Storage</strong> by Sean Cohen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The OpenStack Cinder Backup service was introduced in Cinder in the Grizzly release to allow users to create backups from their volumes and store it to their Swift object storage system (still very common use case in OpenStack private clouds to date). Since then, the Backup API continued to mature with every release.</p>

<p>I love this time of year - the energy and passion that swells right around an upstream OpenStack release, and the weeks before an OpenStack Summit. Most of the year, people are heads down working on their particular part of the project, but as we near a release, there's a lot of interest in what's going on in the larger upstream.</p>

<p>There's also a huge surge in things to announce around the RDO community, as well as the upstream OpenStack community:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>The <a href="http://releases.openstack.org/mitaka/schedule.html">upstream release of Mitaka</a> is this week. <a href="http://stackalytics.com/?metric=commits">Stackalytics</a> lists over 2500 people who have contributed to this release.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>We'll be conducting a <a href="https://www.rdoproject.org/testday/mitaka/ga/">test day for RDO Mitaka on April 13th and 14th</a>.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><a href="http://openstack.org/summit">OpenStack Summit</a> is just 2 weeks away, and we'll be having an <a href="https://www.openstack.org/summit/austin-2016/summit-schedule/events/6892">RDO BoF</a> (Birds of a Feather) gathering there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>If you have something you'd like to demo in the RDO booth at OpenStack Summit, add your idea to the <a href="https://etherpad.openstack.org/p/rdo-austin-summit-booth">booth schedule etherpad</a>.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>And, as every week, there are lots of <a href="http://rdoproject.org/events/">OpenStack Meetups</a> all over the world this week. Especially don't miss Perry Meyers' RDO Q&amp;A at the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/Morgantown-Linux-User-Group/events/227482742/">Morgantown OpenStack Meetup</a>.</p>

<p><strong>The OpenStack Schizophrenia</strong> by Julien Danjou</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When I started contributing to OpenStack, almost five years ago, it was a small ecosystem. There were no foundation, a handful of projects and you could understand the code base in a few days.
Fast forward 2016, and it is a totally different beast. The project grew to no less than 54 teams, each team providing one or more deliverable. For example, the Nova and Swift team each one produces one service and its client, whereas the Telemetry team produces 3 services and 3 different clients.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>My last post showed how to allocate an additional VM for Tripleo. Now I’m going to go through the steps to deploy FreeIPA on it. However, since I went through all of the effort to write Ossipee and Rippowam, I am going to use those to do the heavy lifting.</p>

<p>On Tuesday evening I had the privilege of addressing the <a href="http://www.meetup.com/OpenStack-STL/events/229344473/">St. Louis OpenStack Meetup group</a>. I gave an Introduction to OpenStack presentation to about 30 attendees, many of whom were indeed OpenStack beginners, or just beginning to research what this OpenStack thing is all about.</p>

<p>Here's what RDO enthusiasts have been blogging about in the last week:</p>

<p><strong>Tie Your Rabbit Down</strong> by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve been running the Tripleo Quickstart to setup my development deployments. While looking into the setup, I noticed that the default Rabbit deployment is wide open. I can’t see anything other than firewall port blocking in place. I dug deeper.</p>

<p><strong>Red Hat confirms over 35 sessions at OpenStack Summit, Austin – Have a look!</strong> by Jeff Jameson</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As this Spring’s 2016 OpenStack Summit in Austin, TX nears, the Foundation has posted the final session agenda, outlining the week’s schedule of events. I am pleased to see that based on your voting, Red Hat continues to remain in sync with the current topics, projects, and technologies the OpenStack community and customers are most interested in. With the expectation of the largest attendee crowd yet, and some exciting advancements around containers, storage, networking, compute, and more, we look forward to sharing the 35+ generally accepted sessions, workshops, and BoFs that will be included in the weeks agenda.</p>

<p><strong>Dependency Injection in Python applied to Ossipee</strong> by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I reworked my OpenStack API based cluster builder Ossipee last weekend. It makes heavy use of dependency resolution now, and breaks apart the super-base class into properly scoped components.</p>

<p><strong>Convert a keystone.rc from V2 to V3</strong> by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Everything seems to produce V2 versions of the necessary variables for Keystone, and I am more and more dependant on the V3 setup. Converting from one to the other is trivial, especially if the setup uses the default domain.</p>

<p><strong>Long Term OpenStack Usage Summary</strong> by SilverSkySoft</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Its been about 9 months since we first kicked off a limited production install of OpenStack. There were few variables we were very interested in: How much specialized support was needed to maintain a small OpenStack and stability.</p>

<p><strong>Learn what’s coming in OpenStack “Mitaka”</strong> by Jeff Jameson</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>As the fastest growing open source project in history, OpenStack releases fairly rapidly, with new releases twice per year. Each time, around April and October of every year, a whole plethora of new features and functions move from incubated development status to fully-baked features and accepted into the “core” OpenStack release. Rapidly approaching is the new “Mitaka” release, the 13th release of OpenStack, filled with some great new features.</p>

<p><strong>Attempt to set up RDO Mitaka (RC1) at any given time (Delorean trunks)</strong> by Boris Derzhavets</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>"The RDO project has a continuous integration pipeline that consists of multiple jobs that deploy and test OpenStack as accomplished by different installers. This vast test coverage attempts to ensure that there are no known issues either in packaging, in code or in the installers themselves.Once a Delorean consistent repository has undergone these tests successfully, it will be promoted to current-passed-ci. Current-passed-ci represents the latest and greatest
version of RDO trunk packages that were tested together successfully"</p>

<p>I was traveling much of last week, so we have two weeks of blog posts to catch you up on, and there's some really good ones in here.</p>

<p><strong>"RDO Manager" is now "TripleO"</strong>, by K Rain Leander</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Because of its unique branding and name, one might assume that "RDO Manager" is not TripleO - perhaps it has additional downstream patches or maybe they're entirely different projects. You would not be alone because the community, the users and the developers alike have shared their confusion on this topic.</p>

<p><strong>RDO Kilo ML2&amp;OVS&amp;VLAN Mutti Node Deployment on Fedora 23</strong> by Boris Derzhavets</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>To complete packstack run for two nodes Controller/Network and Compute
setup I had to apply as pre-installation following patches, otherwise neutron
puppet crashed on Fedora 23 :-</p>

<p><strong>How i started contributing to the RDO Project</strong> by Chandan Kumar</p>

<p><strong>What Can Talk To What on the OpenStack Message Broker</strong> by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If a hypervisor is compromised, the Nova Compute instance running on that node is also compromised. If the compute instance is compromised, then its access to the Message Queue has to be considered tainted as well. What degree of risk does this pose?</p>

<p><strong>Setup DVR on RDO Liberty Controller &amp;&amp; 2(x)Computes ML2/OVS/VLAN landscape</strong> by Boris Derzhavets</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Just a reminder in Juno and Kilo DVR was available for deployments using VXLAN tunneling and required l2population activation on all nodes. One of new features of Liberty is DVR compatibility with ML2&amp;OVS&amp;VLAN deployed landscapes. On RDO Liberty packstack doesn't play so nicely doing VLAN deployment as in case of  VXLAN tunneling. Attempt to use old templates for answer file just does all configs properly only on Controller/Network Node.</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack Infra: Jenkins Jobs</strong> by Arie Bregman</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A few days ago, while adding a new job to OpenStack Infra, I realized how difficult it must be for newcomers ( to OpenStack) to understand how OpenStack CI works and make new changes. The OpenStack Infra documentation coverage of each project is great and very detailed , but connecting the dots, which  assembles the complete work-flow can be a complex task for anyone.</p>

<p><strong>Glance Mitaka: Passing the torch</strong> by Flavio Percoco</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I'm not going to run for Glance's PTL position for the Newton timeframe. There are many motivations behind this choice. Some of them I'm willing to discuss in private if people are interested but I'll go as far as saying there are personal and professional reasons for me to not run again.</p>

<p><strong>HA support for DVR centralized default SNAT functionality on RDO Mitaka Milestone 3</strong> by Boris Derzhavets</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Verification been done bellow is actually targeting conversion of HAProxy/Keepalived (Active/Active) 3 Node Controller which design was suggested for RDO Liberty  in https://github.com/beekhof/osp-ha-deploy/blob/master/HA-keepalived.md
