<p><strong>Ceph for Cinder in TripleO</strong>, by Giulio Fidente</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A wrap up on the status of TripleO's Cinder HA spec. First, a link to the cinder-ha blueprint, where you can find even more links, to the actual spec (under review) and the code changes (again, still under review). Intent of the blueprint is for the TripleO deployments to keep Cinder volumes available and Cinder operational in case of failures of any node.</p>

<p><strong>Running nova-libvirt and nova-docker on the same host</strong>, by Lars Kellogg-Steddma</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I regularly use OpenStack on my laptop with libvirt as my hypervisor. I was interested in experimenting with recent versions of the nova-docker driver, but I didn't have a spare system available on which to run the driver, and I use my regular nova-compute service often enough that I didn't want to simply disable it temporarily in favor of nova-docker.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>One of the new features available in the Juno release of OpenStack is support for serial console access to your Nova servers. This post looks into how to configure the serial console feature and then how to access the serial consoles of your Nova servers.</p>

<p><strong>Rhones-Alpes meetup summary</strong>, by Flavio Percoco</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I love meetups. They are a more intimate moment for local communities to get closer, interact and dive into topics related to the main focus of the meetup group. I organize myself 3 meetups in Milan and I really enjoy the opportunity to get to know local people and learn from them. However, it's also really important to participate in and learn from other non-local communities. Therefore, I'm always looking forward to attend - and hopefully talk - in other meetups around my continent - going to other continents for a meetup would be harder to afford.</p>

<p><strong>Building a minimal web server for testing Kubernetes</strong>, by Lars Kellogg-Stedman</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I have recently been doing some work with Kubernetes, and wanted to put together a minimal image with which I could test service and pod deployment. Size in this case was critical: I wanted something that would download quickly when initially deployed, because I am often setting up and tearing down Kubernetes as part of my testing (and some of my test environments have poor external bandwidth).</p>

<p>Here's what RDO engineers have been writing about in the last week.</p>

<p>If you're writing about RDO, or about OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora or RHEL, and you're not on my list, please let me know!</p>

<p>Three Flavours of Infrastructure Cloud, by Zane Bitter</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>A curious notion that seems to be doing the rounds of the OpenStack traps at the moment is the idea that Infrastructure-as-a-Service clouds must by definition be centred around the provisioning of virtual machines. The phrase ‘small, stable core’ keeps popping up in a way that makes it sound like a kind of dog-whistle code for the idea that other kinds of services are a net liability. Some members of the Technical Committee have even got on board and proposed that the development of OpenStack should be reorganised around the layering of services on top of Nova.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Isn’t Atomic on OpenStack Ironic, don’t you think?, by Steven Dake</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>OpenStack Ironic is a bare metal as a service deployment tool.  Fedora Atomic is a µOS consisting of a very minimal installation of Linux, kernel.org, Kubernetes and Docker.  Kubernetes is an endpoint manager and container scheduler, while Docker is a container manager.  The basic premise of Fedora Atomic using Ironic is to present a lightweight launching mechanism for OpenStack.</p>

<p>Fedora Cloud Images Available Today! by Rich Bowen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The Fedora Project has released Fedora 21 today, and it includes two images of interest to RDO users who want have the latest and greatest Fedora to run in their cloud.</p>

<p>Cloud-init and the case of the changing hostname, by Lars Kellogg-Stedman</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I ran into a problem earlier this week deploying RDO Icehouse under RHEL 6. My target systems were a set of libvirt guests deployed from the RHEL 6 KVM guest image, which includes cloud-init in order to support automatic configuration in cloud environments. I take advantage of this when using libvirt by attaching a configuration drive so that I can pass in ssh keys and a user-data script.</p>

<p>The Fedora Project <a href="http://fedoramagazine.org/announcing-fedora-21/">has released Fedora 21 today</a>, and it includes two images of interest to RDO users who want have the latest and greatest Fedora to run in their cloud.</p>

<p>The Fedora Project, as part of the Fedora.Next initiative, decided to pursue three sesparate release variants – cloud, server, and workstation. Of special interest to RDO users, the Cloud Working Group has an OpenStack-ready release with a base Fedora instance that's tailored for the cloud, and an <a href="http://projectatomic.io">"Atomic" host</a> that is tailored specifically for running Docker containers.</p>

<p>Head over to the <a href="https://getfedora.org/en/cloud/download/">Get Fedora Cloud Download page</a>, and you'll find uncompressed qcow2 images for general purpose cloud compting, and the streamlined Atomic host.</p>

<p>The default images are 64-bit, but you can also find a 32-bit qcow2 general purpose image if you need a 32-bit instance for some reason.</p>

<p>Have questions about the Fedora Cloud images? Ask on the <a href="https://admin.fedoraproject.org/mailman/listinfo/cloud">Fedora Cloud mailing list</a> or ask in #fedora-cloud on Freenode.</p>

<p>Here's the blog posts that came out of the RDO community last two weeks. Last week, I was in Budapest at ApacheCon Europe, and so missed doing this post.</p>

<p>If you're writing about RDO, or about OpenStack on CentOS, Fedora or RHEL, and you're not on my list, please let me know!</p>

<p><strong>Delivering Public Cloud Functionality in OpenStack</strong>, by John Meadows</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When it comes to delivering cloud services, enterprise architects have a common request to create a public cloud-type rate plan for showback, chargeback, or billing. Public cloud packaging is fairly standardized across the big vendors as innovations are quickly copied by others and basic virtual machines are assessed mainly on price.</p>

<p><strong>Faster rebuilds for python virtualenv trees</strong>, by Daniel P. Berrangé</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When developing on OpenStack, it is standard practice for the unit test suites to be run in a python virtualenv. With the Nova project at least, and I suspect most others too, setting up the virtualenv takes a significant amount of time as there are many packages to pull down from PyPI, quite a few of which need compilation too.</p>

<p><strong>Creating a Windows image for OpenStack</strong>, by Lars Kellogg-Stedman</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you want to build a Windows image for use in your OpenStack environment, you can follow the example in the official documentation, or you can grab a Windows 2012r2 evaluation pre-built image from the nice folks at CloudBase.</p>

<p><strong>Dynamic Policy in Keystone</strong>, by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Ever get that feeling that an epiphany is right around the corner? I spent a good portion of the OpenStack summit with that feeling. I knew that it would not be earth shattering, or lead me to want to rewrite Keystone, but rather a clarification of how a bunch of things should fall together. The “click” happened on the second to last day, and it can be summarized in a few key points.</p>

<p><strong>Co-Existence of Containers and Virtualization Technologies</strong>, by  Federico Simoncelli</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Lately there has been a growing interest in Linux containers solutions such as Docker. Docker provides an open and standardized platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. The application images can be safely held in your organization registry or they can be shared publicly in the docker hub portal for everyone to use and to contribute to.</p>

<p><strong>Hiding unnecessary complexity</strong>, by Flavio Percoco</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>How deep does someone need to go to consider something as learned? When does the required knowledge to do/learn X ends? Furthermore, I'm most interested in what we - as developers or creators of these abstractions that will then be consumed - can do to define this.</p>

<p><strong>Red Hat, Nuage Networks, OpenStack, and KISS</strong>, from RedHatStack</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The reality is that IT is serious money – IDC estimates that the Internet of Things (IoT) market alone will hit $7.1 trillion by 2020! But a lot of that money is due to the IT industry practice of “lock-in” – trapping a customer into a proprietary technology and then charging high costs, in some instances up to 10X cost, for every component   For some reason, customers object to having to pick one vendor’s approach, being subject to limitations – whether technological or otherwise, paying high markups for every incremental extension, then having to pay high switching costs for the next solution at end of life in five years or less.</p>

<p><strong>Non-opinionated software can't exist</strong>, by Flavio Percoco</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I don't believe there's such a thing like "non opinionated" software and I think we should all be more careful when we communicate what the goals of our projects are. The later may not be new to you, probably not even the former but yet, I keep hearing the former everywhere and I keep seeing the later being ignored.</p>

<p><strong>Three Reasons Why OpenStack has Matured</strong>, by David H. Deans</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The OpenStack Summit, taking place in Paris, France this week, will be a turning point for those of us that study market development activity within the cloud computing infrastructure marketplace. I attended my first OpenStack Summit earlier this year, in Atlanta, Georgia. During the event conference sessions, I was immediately engaged by the apparent enthusiasm and energy of the other attendees.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Depending on your point of view, there are different ways to assess the progress of the evolving OpenStack project. Yesterday, I profiled “three reasons” why I believe there are encouraging signs that demonstrate how OpenStack has matured — and I gave an example of existing application case studies, as a key indicator.</p>

<p><strong>Building Docker images with Puppet</strong> by Lars Kellogg-Stedman</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I like Docker, but I'm not a huge fan of using shell scripts for complex system configuration…and Dockerfiles are basically giant shell scripts.</p>

  <p>I was curious whether or not it would be possible to use Puppet during the docker build process. As a test case, I used the ssh module included in the openstack-puppet-modules package.</p>

<p><strong>Delivering the Complete Open-Source Cloud Infrastructure and Software-Defined-Storage Story</strong> by neilwlevine</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The OpenStack summit in Paris not only marks the release of Juno to the public but also the 6 month mark since Red Hat acquired Inktank, the commercial company behind Ceph. The acquisition not only underscored Red Hat’s commitment to use open source to disrupt the storage market, as it did in the operating system market with Linux, but also its investment in OpenStack where Ceph is a market leading scale-out storage platform, especially for block.</p>

<p><strong>Who can sign for what?</strong> by Adam Young</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In my last post, I discussed how to extract the signing information out of a token. But just because the signature on a document is valid does not mean that the user who signed it was authorized to do so. How can we got from a signature to validating a token? Can we use that same mechanism to sign other OpenStack messages?</p>

<p><strong>LinuxCon/KVMForum/CloudOpen Eu 2014</strong> by Kashyap Chamarthy</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>While the Linux Foundation’s colocated events (LinuxCon/KVMForum/CloudOpen, Plumbers and a bunch of others) are still in progress (Düsseldorf, Germany), thought I’d quickly write a note here.</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack Instance HA Proposal</strong> by Russell Bryant</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In a perfect world, every workload that runs on OpenStack would be a cloud native application that is horizontally scalable and fault tolerant to anything that may cause a VM to go down.  However, the reality is quite different.</p>

<p><strong>libvirt blockcommit: shorten disk image chain by live merging the current active disk content</strong> by Kashyap Chamarthy</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>When using QCOW2-based external snapshots, it is desirable to reduce an entire disk image chain to a single disk to retain performance and increase while the guest is running. Upstream QEMU and libvirt has recently acquired the ability to do that. Relevant git commits for QEMU (Jeff Cody) and libvirt (Eric Blake).</p>

<p><strong>Fedora packaging workshop</strong> by Matthias Runge</p>

  <p>On 17th and 18th this month, we'll have a local Linux conference here. As part of this, I'll give a short introductory workshop on packaging. The following series of posts helps me, to sort things for me and to provide a short reference for others and myself as well.</p>

<p><strong>Mentoring others and yourself</strong> by Flavio Percoco</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Mentoring is one of the things I enjoy the most doing. I don't consider myself the ultimate expert on things but I've definitely gone through enough things that had led me to become a mentor on different technical areas.</p>
