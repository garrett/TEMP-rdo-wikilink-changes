<b>Speaker: Assaf Muller</b>
</p>
<p>Join me for an architectural, developer oriented overview of (GRE and
VXLAN) tunnels in OpenStack Networking.</p>

<p>In the virtualization environment virtual machines are hosted on
hypervisors. These VMs then obtain network connectivity via software
switches run in the same hypervisors. Data centers that provide
infrastructure as a service have (hopefully) multiple customers (Or
'tenants'). As you can imagine we don't want tenants' VMs interacting
with one another.</p>

<p>VLANs are a natural approach to achieve tenant segregation. However, how
do we maintain scalability with a growing number of hypervisors and VMs,
when the administrator has to constantly configure the hardware switches
manually? Is there another way?</p>

<p>We all use VPNs to connect to our office resources remotely, or to
connect two office sites into one seamless network. VPNs are essentially
encrypted tunnels, but what are tunnels?</p>

<p>Tunnels allow us to wrap packets inside more packets. In our context -
VM traffic in exterior IP packets. That way, to the intermediate
networking hardware, it looks like traffic between the hypervisors.
Since the hypervisors should already be able to talk to each other, this
makes VM connectivity a breeze!</p>

<p>Let's explore how tunnels are used in the cloud as a means to achieve an
overlay network. What is an overlay network? How does traffic flow
between virtual machines on the same hypervisor, and on different
hypervisors? What are the similarities between a layer 2 learning switch
and tunnel logic in OpenStack? How does Open vSwitch fit in? Is there a
cost to using tunnels?</p>

<p>This talk will be useful to developers interested in learning about new
networking concepts - Minimal background knowledge will be assumed.</p>

<b>Speaker: Mike Kolesnik</b>
</p>
<p>As the prominent open-source data center virtualization solution, oVirt
relies on a powerful and easy approach to configuring a data center's
network. By leveraging the advanced network capabilities offered by
OpenStack Networking, oVirt's maintainers aim to bring this field even
further, allowing data center administrators to use advanced networking
capabilities while maintaining the simplicity of oVirt's network
management approach.</p>

<p>Developers &amp; Users are welcome to join us in this session, and to
discover how oVirt currently leverages OpenStack Networking, and see the
road-map to future network virtualization in the Data Center, all using
open source enterprise-grade software.</p>

<p>In this session you will learn how the Orchestration capabilities of
OpenStack, provided by the Heat project, can help make the
deployment and management of your cloud workloads simpler and more
robust by allowing you to represent infrastructure as code.
If you have requirements related to orchestrating applications on
OpenStack clouds, this session will help you understand what Heat
is, an overview of how to use it, key terminology, template language
concepts, and details of the current and planned features.
Included in this session will be information about the new HOT DSL,
providers/environments abstractions, and latest
software-configuration capabilities for Icehouse. Finally you will
see a demo of Heat in action!

<p>The Savanna project, currently in incubation under the OpenStack
Data Processing program, provides users an ability to provision and
manage Hadoop clusters on OpenStack, and has seen a great deal of
progress, development, and changes during the Icehouse development
cycle. The focus of the project is on two primary use cases:
on-demand cluster provisioning and on-demand Hadoop task execution
(Elastic Data Processing).
In this talk, we will provide an overview of project Savanna, its
main goals and focus, and a tour of new features introduced in the
Icehouse cycle. These features include: integration with Heat, basic
API tests in Tempest, enabled asynchronous gate, and bunch of new
Elastic Data Processing (EDP) features. We’ll also discuss new
Hortonworks Data Platform plugin features, data-locality support,
and the ability to use Savanna through the command line. Finally, we
will discuss the roadmap for the Juno release.
After attending this session, you will have a good understanding for
where Savanna is now and where it’s going, particularly with regard
to the Unified Agent approach, on which we’re currently working on
leveraging in Savanna.</p>

</p>
<p>As a cloud deployment grows both in size and in variety of workloads
it is useful to be able to segregate compute resources based on
factors such as physical location, networking connections, or the
availability of specialized hardware. OpenStack provides a number of
options for segregating compute resources in the cloud including:
- Cells,
- Host Aggregates,
- Regions, and
- Availability Zones.
The differences between each of these approaches are nuanced and
often misunderstood. Additionally the capabilities available when
using some of these techniques, particularly Host Aggregates and
Cells, have been expanded in recent OpenStack releases.
This session will provide an indepth look into these each of these
options for segregating resources in the OpenStack cloud including
their pros and cons, example use cases, and performance
considerations.</p>

In many installations, software is deployed via software packages.
When updating or upgrading software via distribution packages, in

overwritten. In this session, we'll show, how to achieve both,
changes and not to break due package updates or even upgrades.</p>

<p>In large deployments, some piece of Nova is deployed almost
everywhere.
Until recently, the story for how you upgrade to using a newer
version of this fast-paced project has been turn off the cloud" –
an unacceptable answer for something that aims to be deployed at a
scale large enough to make such a plan unfeasible. Over the last
several releases, "upgrade-ability" has been a major theme of
development for the Nova team, shooting for both reduced downtime of
core components and elimination of the need to "turn off the cloud"
while thousands of nodes are upgraded atomically.
This talk will cover the incremental steps we have made in
recent cycles, as well as reveal the major new capability that
the Icehouse release brings to the table.</p>

workflows, operation over private Neutron networks and execution on
transient clusters. We’ll start with a description of EDP’s general
concepts and a definition of terms, then its current status in
Savanna, supported Data Sources, Job Types, data locality and the
roadmap for the Juno release cycle.
Lastly, we’ll show a live demo of EDP to bring all of these concepts

<p>The Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC) will be a public cloud based on a
new model that allows many companies and institutions to participate
in its implementation and operation. MOC is bringing multiple
vendors together within a single infrastructure, hence fostering
collaboration and interoperability amongst them. Several industry
partners have joined the effort and been instrumental in the initial
implementation of MOC. 
The goal for MOC is to foster interoperability and innovation
amongst insterested parties and the opportunity to explore new
computing models.
This session will provide an overview of the architecture and it's
evolution
- Blueprint to build a multi-vendor cloud infrastrucutre
    - Architecture decisions and guidance
    - Considerations for scale, operations and upgrades
- Lessons learned from the initial deployment to operations will be covered 
    - Automation of deployments and extending the infrastructure
    - Orchestration of workloads based on SLAs and QoS requirements
    - Operational aspects and tools
    - Best practices and architecture decisions are shared and key technology areas highlighted (Neutron, Cinder, Deployment, Operations, Upgrades etc)</p>

<p>We will also cover use cases for applications deployed on the MOC
cloud, ranging from Big Data analytics, PaaS and others
With the participation of several key Boston universities such as
Harvard, Boston University, MIT and North Eastern, UMass and other
parthers MOC will evolve into a large scale open cloud
infrastructure</p>

<p>Until the Icehouse release of Heat, configuring software on
orchestrated compute resources has required a cumbersome combination
of declarative configuration, shell scripts and wait conditions.
Heat now has a flexible mechanism to configure software throughout
the life-cycle of compute resources. It is also now possible to
integrate with software configuration tools such as Puppet or Chef,
allowing configuration to be represented in a number of different
ways.
In this session you will learn a number of different approaches to
configuring software using Heat such as cloud-init, shell scripts,
Puppet and golden images. You will also learn how to add support for
other configuration management tools.</p>

can be explored. These include an operator dashboard, infrastructure
instrumentation agents, bare metal drivers and other supporting
services. Hardware and software vendors can gain insight into what
integration looks like from a product point of view.</p>

<p>In this session, we will explore:
- Why TripleO works for infrastructure management
- TripleO management integration points
- What TripleO means for hardware/software vendors
- Early work in this area</p>

<p>Red Hat uses OpenStack Swift as the object storage interface to
GlusterFS. Instead of reimplementing the Swift API, Red Hat is
participating in the OpenStack Swift community to ensure that
GlusterFS can take full advantage of the latest Swift features. This
is absolutely the right way to pair Swift with another storage
system - use the existing functionality in Swift and contribute back
to community where additional functionality is needed. This talk
from their respective project leads will show how Swift and
GlusterFS work together to take advantage of the best each system
has to offer.</p>

</p>
<p>Like many open-source projects, OpenStack uses a time-based release
model. Feature development happens in a flurry of activity in the
first part of each release cycle and then we taper, allowing enough
time for many eyes to make shallow bugs" and for us to gain enough
confidence in the quality of our release candidates. Even after a
release, we continue to maintain a stable branch for issues found
and fixed post-release.</p>

<p>Linux distros apply a similar model when they bring together the
releases of many open-source projects into a coherent, usable and
stable product. OpenStack's predictable release schedule, the
tapering, the stabilization and the post-release maintenance are all
essential to the needs of distros and, in turn, the users of those
distros.</p>

<p>Unusually, OpenStack also explicitly caters to another type of users -
what we call "trunk chasers". Public cloud providers like HP and
Rackspace invest significantly in a continuous delivery pipeline
so that they can keep pace with OpenStack development, deploy
regularly, give timely feedback upstream and minimize the risk
associated with each incremental update. In these days of agile
development, DevOps and continuous delivery, the benefits of such
a model are now clear.</p>

<p>As such, OpenStack is an important case study for how recent
thinking around continuous delivery is influencing open-source
projects. Many questions remain unanswered, however. Are we going
to continue to see projects like OpenStack see themselves as
catering to two radically different audiences, or is this the
beginning of fundamental shift in open-source?</p>

<p>Mark and Monty - Openstack Technical Committee and Foundation
Board members, prominent OpenStack contributors and senior
engineering leaders at Red Hat and HP - have had the opportunity
to look at this dilemma from several different angles. In the
talk, they will delve into some of the details behind how
OpenStack caters to both models. They will examine the mindset and
needs of each audience. They will talk about topics such as CI,
upgrades, deployment tools, reference architectures, community
management, feature development, user feedback and more.</p>

<p>Attendees can hope to learn some more about OpenStack and some of
the challenges in running an open-source project, building a
distro or maintaining a public cloud. Beyond OpenStack, however,
the talk should provide some more general food for thought around
the agile development methodologies used by many application
developers today versus the methodologies used by open-source
projects today.</p>

<p>How has the OpenStack User Experience (UX) group contributed to the OpenStack Community over the past year? In this session, you'll get to hear how the UX group is helping to shape features and improve the overall user experience in OpenStack and verifying that designs are meeting target end users needs. We will give highlights of our progress in the following areas</p>

<ul>
  <li>Understanding the OpenStack users</li>
  <li>Requirements gathering</li>
  <li>Interaction design</li>
  <li>Design support during development</li>
  <li>Usability testing and feeding results back into new requirements</li>
</ul>

<p>We will also discuss the recent efforts, which builds on Dave Neary's previous work, to develop a set of personas to help the development community align with their users' needs and tasks.  We'll review the methodology used to develop the personas, insights from the user interviews, and the personas created from the effort.  Finally, we will provide recommendations and examples for how the community can effectively use the personas during their own planning, design, development, and testing efforts to improve the overall user experience.</p>

<p>Once you've got your OpenStack infrastructure in place, automating
and managing application deployment is your next challenge to
tackle. In this panel, we'll discuss the tools, approaches and
frameworks available for OpenStack based application deployment
today. 
Questions that we will cover in this panel include
- What considerations apply to choosing a particular approach or toolset?
- How are specific tools able to complement each other and interoperate?
- What are the advantages/disadvantages of tools that are solely focused on OpenStack and those that support OpenStack among other platforms?
- How significant are standardisation efforts such as TOSCA? How can we practically apply them?
- Will the use of linux containers such as Docker turn the use of existing configuration management obsolete?
- Is there one tool to win them all?</p>

<p>OpenStack continues to grow exponentially as the de facto standard
for open source Cloud platforms. But how can someone quickly get
started with learning this exciting new technology? This
workshop will walk participants through an overview of the
OpenStack components and offer practical suggestions and
resources for learning OpenStack. To demonstrate one way to get
started, we will assist workshop attendees to set up a
multi-node OpenStack cloud, on their laptops, using Red Hat's
RDO and the
Packstack utility.</p>

<p>Participants will be introduced to a range of cloud
functionality including those that were added to the Icehouse
release. During the workshop, participants will have the
opportunity to the following:
- Installing OpenStack on their laptops
- Walking through the Horizon dashboard
- Adding new users
- Adding an image to Glance
- Defining networks in Neutron
- Starting a new virtual server
- Creating and attaching Cinder storage volumes to virtual servers
- Storing objects in Swift Using the Horizon Dashboard user interface
- Exploring Ceilometer metrics
- Instructions to prepare for the workshop can be found at <a href="http://openstack.redhat.com/GettingStartedIcehouse_w_GRE">http://openstack.redhat.com/GettingStartedIcehouse_w_GRE</a></p>

<p>Designate provides DNSaaS services for OpenStack.
This interactive workshop will guide attendees on how Designate can
be installed with PowerDNS. For the purposes of the workshop the
various designate components will be installed on a single node.
Once installed it shows some of the V1 and V2 APIs for domain and
record management. The workshop will conclude by using a tool like
dig to retrieve the added records from the PowerDNS backend, showing
a fully functional by-hand deployment.
The workshop will also cover the steps for contributing to the
development of Designate.
Several of the Designate contributors will be on hand during the
workshop to help attendees work through the deployment.</p>

<p>The Massachusetts Open Cloud (MOC) is a new, non-profit public cloud
being created in Massachusetts. It will be the product of
collaboration between the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, five large
research universities (MIT, Harvard, BU, NE, and UMass), and an
array of private sector partners. It will be located at the 15MW
Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC) in
Holyoke.
The MOC will stand apart from existing single-provider clouds by
enabling multiple entities to provide (rather than just consume)
computing resources and services on a level playing field. Big and
small companies, and even researchers, can expose their hardware or
software services through the MOC, make them available to a large
community of users, and derive revenue from doing so.
We will discuss the vision and status of the project, the central
role OpenStack plays in its implementation, and some of the required
changes needed in OpenStack to enable a multi-provider open cloud.</p>

<p>Hard to believe another quarter has gone by in the world of Ceph development! 
So much has happened with the release of Firefly (late, but well worth 
the wait!), another smashing OpenStack Developer Summit, and of course 
the acquisition of Inktank. As the dust settles from all of the hustle and bustle 
we’re looking to get back on track with development.</p>

<p>So, since it has been a while since our last summit we thought it would be a 
good idea to have another “interim” summit to discuss work in flight, anything 
new that may have come up, and look forward to both our “Giant” and “Hammer” releases.</p>

<p>Blueprint submissions begin June 2nd, and end June 16th. The schedule will be posted
after all blueprints are received, and start on June 24 and carry over to June 25
if needed.</p>
