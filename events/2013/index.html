<b>Speaker: Mark McLoughlin</b>
</p>
<p>The advent of IaaS has brought about a new style of application
architecture built around the idea that the components of your
architecture should be fine-grained programmable resources. This allows
applications to be resilient and scalable, but also allows the operation
of the application to be fully automated.</p>

<p>Mark will discuss how OpenStack was designed from the ground up with
these same principles in mind and can be deployed in a highly resilient
and fault tolerant manner. Mark will go on to explain how you should aim
to build on OpenStack's architecture so that operating an OpenStack
cloud is as automated as operating a modern cloud based application.</p>

<b>Speaker: Tomas Sedovic</b>
</p>
<p>Deploying complex systems on OpenStack can be a challenge.</p>

<p>A small website running MediaWiki can happily fit on a single server,
but the same software running at the Wikipedia scale is much more
demanding. You need to deal with multiple database servers, web servers,
load balancers, failover, networking configuration, IP address
assignment and more.</p>

<p>The Heat project allows you to describe all the resources and their
relationships in a single template, launch everything with one command
and keep it up. You can easily combine the workflow with existing
configuration management tools such as Puppet or Chef.</p>

<p>Initially modeled after Amazon CloudFormation, Heat is a free and open
source component for OpenStack and has recently been accepted into
OpenStack incubation.</p>

<p>This session will provide an overview of Heat's capabilities and how to
use them, followed by a live demonstration. At the end you will
understand Heat well enough to decide whether it is useful in your
environment and how to get started with it.</p>

<p>Ceilometer is an OpenStack incubated project which started in April 2012
with the goal to provide a unique interface point to provide measurement
in OpenStack. Our purpose for measurement started with a focus on
metering (for billing) and has since been extended to other targets such
as monitoring and alerting. This project is a collaboration of a wide
variety of actors.</p>

<p>After a brief introduction of the project past and future, this talk
will introduce the audience to the project's architecture before digging
into how and why they can contribute to its future.</p>

<p>How can you mix traditional virtualization infrastructure and a private
hosted IaaS solution? oVirt and OpenStack can work very well together to
address your traditional virtualization needs, and to facilitate your
migration of workloads to the cloud.</p>

<p>Personas were made famous by Alan Moore in "The Inmates are Running the
Asylum," a seminal book on user interface design for computer
programmers. They have been used for decades in the marketing industry,
in user experience design, and in product planning to help target
specific market segments with features, ads, and product design.</p>

<p>Personas help you frame feature discussions while developing your
software, guide your communication and event strategy, and ultimately
help you to have a more popular, better project. As the OpenStack
project evolves beyond its original base and seeks to engage with a
broader user community, understanding the profile of OpenStack users
becomes critical in increasing participation and thus improving the
project.</p>

<p>This session will cover the basics of: * What is a persona and why
should I care? * How do I come up with persona(s) for my project? *
What can I do with personas?</p>

<p>This session will be useful to those interested in better understanding
their target audiences, and specifically those seeking to grow a
community around an open source project.</p>

<b>Speaker: Dianne Mueller</b>
</p>
<p>RedHat has created it's own OpenStack distribution that is now in
preview and still a bit rough around the edges, but promises to include
what is needed to deploy &amp; evaluate a truly &amp; complete Open Cloud
environment. In addition, Red Hat wants there to be a widely used
open-source community developed PaaS model for the cloud which includes
being open to participation by a community of peers.</p>

<p>To really create a open cloud environment and to make it useful, you
need to complete the stack with an PaaS. Just getting a cloud
environment up and running is no longer enough. The challenge that
OpenStack faces is how to get people, applications and services working
on OpenStack out of the box.</p>

<p>One approach to the problem is to combining all the necessary pieces
that go into building an OpenStack cloud (compute, storage, networking,
management) with a platform as a service (PaaS) into your OpenStack
distribution.</p>

<p>OpenShift Origin project is licensed under the Apache License 2.0, a
permissive and widely-used open source license, which was selected so
that the code would be available for use by the broadest range of</p>

<p>individuals and organizations. This is the same license chosen by the
OpenStack project, for much the same reason. This license is already
well known and understood by individuals and organizations already
involved in cloud computing and in enterprise scale open source
development.</p>

<p>In this session, I'll discuss RedHat's efforts with OpenStack, Fedora, &amp;
OpenShift Origin to create a more complete OpenStack distribution. Our
community initiatives to ensure Origin easily and seamlessly integrates
on any OpenStack distribution and how to you can add Origin into your
own OpenStack distributions.</p>

<p>Charles Babbage's Difference Engine amazed Ada Lovelace with its
unprecedented engineering feats just like OpenStack amazes people today.
We have some stories to share about learning, exploring new territory
and making new connections. This story is about newcomers working on
OpenStack as interns. Three were in the GNOME Outreach Program for Women
from January to March. One has been an intern twice at two different
OpenStack companies.</p>

<p>For the Outreach Program for Women, three mentors worked with interns;
one from the Image service (glance) project, one from the Dashboard
(horizon) project, and one from the documentation project. For the
company internships, mentors at the company worked with the intern. We
want to share their stories so you can learn about our current OpenStack
internships and future plans for such programs. We will talk about what
they worked on while interning, what struggles they faced while learning
everything about OpenStack, and where they want to go from here. We can
provide metrics that show the impact of involving women in Open Source,
and metrics about the impact these interns have on the projects. We want
to describe the future vision for internship programs based on the
lessons learned recently.</p>

<p>If you are an organization looking to hire OpenStack interns, or a
potential intern seeking an internship, this session is for you.</p>

<p>Security is important when deploying any distributed application
especially the one responsible for running all of the virtual machines
in your data center. When deploying Open Stack, many of the security
implementation details are left unspecified. This is where FreeIPA comes
to the rescue. This session will show how guidance on how FreeIPA can be
used to help secure communication, provide authentication and
authorization capabilities for a large scale Open Stack deployment.</p>

<p>Since its inception in 2009, Deltacloud has been focussed on bridging
the gaps between various IaaS cloud API's by offering a RESTful API that
can be used against various backend clouds. Over time, the project has
been expanded to include frontends for Amazon's EC2 API and DMTF's CIMI.</p>

<p>This talk will provide an overview of what Deltacloud is, what the
supported frontends and backends are, and how to use it with Openstack.
It will also explain how Deltacloud is used be a number of projects to
achieve cross-cloud portability.</p>

<p>RDO is a community supported distribution of the latest releases of
OpenStack for Red Hat Enterprise Linux and its clones like CentOS and
Scientific Linux. We also distribute packages of the latest release of
OpenStack for Fedora. Through a Red Hat developed tool called PackStack,
we have made the installation and configuration process quick and easy.
You can go from a bare operating system to a running instance in as
little as 15 to 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Come and hear about this distribution, and about Red Hat's work in the
OpenStack project.</p>

<p>Red Hat products are built on open source software. Unlike proprietery
software, open source software provides the freedom to use, modify, and
redistribute the code, giving customers an opportunity to engage in the
product development process and preview future Red Hat products.</p>

<p>In this session, Dave Neary will discuss community projects that Red Hat
has sponsored and participated in, including oVirt, OpenStack, JBoss
Application Server, LibreOffice, GNOME, and Fedora. Attendees will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discover the benefits of using community-developed software and
engaging with upstream communities</li>
  <li>Learn about how French services company AlterWay built a public cloud
offering on oVirt</li>
  <li>Preview upcoming Red Hat product features</li>
  <li>Learn about how to influence the development of future features by

<p>Managing storage resources in Linux has traditionally been the realm of
storage teams with deep expertise in the magic of external and internal
RAID arrays and external filers. Technologies like hyper-scale,
openstack and virtualization make it harder than ever to provision,
manage during run time and repair storage. This talk will give a
detailed overview of several upstream projects that are working on
providing all of these environments, as well as traditional bare metal
servers, an easy to use way to set up, run and debug storage and file
systems. Status updates on the component projects and their roadmaps
will also be shared.</p>

<p>PaaS has rightly been celebrated as a way to increase developer
productivity and thereby help companies get the new applications and
services they need online (and making money) faster. But PaaS goes
beyond developers and beyond dev/test. Efficient application
multi-tenancy and auto-scaling are also key features for production
environments. Furthermore, PaaS also means that platform changes can
happen without affecting developers, a big win for architects and
procurement officers. In short, PaaS is for everyone. This session will
help attendees understand how the PaaS landscape is evolving to provide
solutions with appeal across many facets of the IT organization and
beyond. It will touch on key technical enablers that are making this
possible but will focus predominantly on how organizations are using
PaaS today and the benefits that they are seeing by doing so.</p>

<p>Have you ever wondered how KVM is used in a full blown Data Center
virtualization solution? oVirt is an open virtualization project which
enables the management of multi-host, multi-tenant virtual data centers,
including high availability, VM and storage live migration, storage and
network management, system scheduler and more. oVirt provides an
integration point for several open source virtualization technologies,
including kvm, libvirt, spice, oVirt node and numerous OpenStack
components such as Neutron and Glance. The session will provide an
introduction to the oVirt project and shed light on how a data center
administrator's actions in a web UI are translated into KVM commands
running on the hypervisors.</p>

<p>Converged infrastructure is an idea for virtualization infrastructure
that is enabling organizations to deploy more rapidly on a single
commodity hardware platform for both compute and storage infrastructure.
Until recently this was something that was difficult to do with Open
Source software. This presentation provides an overview of what a
converged infrastructure solution looks like and then digs into the Open
Source software that can be used to build successful converged
solutions. With Gluster and oVirt as foundational software packages the
presentation will dig into advanced scenarios for deploying virtual
machines as well as adding additional nodes for both storage and
compute. OpenStack networking, image management, and object store will
be tied in as well to demonstrate the advantages of using Open Source to
solve your organization's virtualization challenges.</p>

<p>As an industry, we’ve mostly moved on from naive notions about cloud
computing being inherently “safe” or “risky.” However, more
sophisticated discussions require both greater nuance and greater rigor.
This presentation takes attendees through frameworks for evaluating and
mitigating potential issues in hybrid cloud environments, discusses key
risk factors to consider, and describes some of the relevant standards
and provider certifications. This is a broad and sometimes complex
topic. However, it’s very manageable if individual risk factors are
considered systematically and specifically. This session will give IT
professionals tools and knowledge to help them make informed decisions.</p>

<p>Should you learn a new skill set to develop mobile applications? Or can
you use your existing skillset and convert your HTML5 + REST mobile web
app to hybrid app? Learning a new skill set can be very frustrating and
time consuming. In this session Shekhar Gulati, Principal OpenShift
Evangelist, will walk through the steps you will need to convert an
existing HTML5 + RESTful Web application to a Hybrid app using Apache
Cordova. Apache Cordova is a platform for building native mobile
applications using HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The Restful backend of the
application will be running on OpenShift – Red Hat's open source public
Platform as a Service.</p>

<p>OpenDaylight is an exciting new community-led, open source project
focused on accelerating adoption of software-defined networking (SDN) by
providing a robust SDN platform on which the industry can build and
innovate. An OpenDaylight controller provides flexible management of
both physical and virtual networks. The open source nature of the
project and its flexible network management capabilities make it an
ideal SDN platform to integrate with Neutron.</p>

<p>In this session, OpenDaylight community members from Cisco, IBM, RedHat,
and Ericsson will describe the OpenDaylight project goals and platform
architecture, as well as the roadmap and progress to date. OpenDaylight
brings together a number of virtual networking approaches, and we will
discuss integration approaches with OpenStack Neutron that provide
flexibility for OpenStack administrators and users. Details of our
initial Neutron integration will also be demonstrated for attendees.</p>

<p>Attendees will leave this session with a greater understanding of what
OpenDaylight is, and how it can integrate with OpenStack Neutron to
provide a powerful SDN-based networking solution for OpenStack Clouds.</p>

<p>OpenStack has experienced a phenomenal growth, but, can it make the leap
from 10s of thousands of community members to 10s of millions? Many
large software ecosystems that have thrived recently have been powered
by developers. So far, enterprise developers have remained largely in
the periphery as far as OpenStack is concerned although there are
serveral use cases like SDLC, Big Data, PaaS atop OpenStack, Hybrid
cloud development, etc. that is aimed squarely at developers. Perhaps,
IaaS will never be interesting to developers? Can some of the newer
initiatives (like Heat) change this?</p>

<p>Attend this panel to hear different perspectives of should OpenStack
appeal to enterprise developers and if so how. Please be armed with the
tough questions and opinions of what does OpenStack mean to enterprise
developers. These stackers have worked with large ecosystem of
developers in their past lives and represent different parts of the
OpenStack ecosystem. More than anything they are not hesitant to speak
their mind and so should you.</p>

<p>Adding an OpenStack environment into an already complex IT architecture
threatens to overwhelm IT staff who are already spending countless hours
managing existing IT architectures. Is it possible to unify the
operational management of existing data center virtualization with an
OpenStack deployment? What about adding a public cloud provider into the
mix? What about adding Platform as a Service capabilities? In this
session, Oleg and James will demonstrate how CloudForms can provide a
unified operational management framework for all of these scenarios and
help IT staff keep their sanity in the process. Subjects explained will
include how to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Discover and monitor new and existing OpenStack environments</li>
  <li>Provide Showback and Chargeback of guest workloads</li>
  <li>Provision workloads via self-service catalogs to OpenStack</li>
  <li>Create migration analysis reports from datacenter virtualization
platforms (including Red Hat Enterprise Virtualization, Microsoft
Hyper-V, VMware vSphere) to OpenStack</li>
</ul>

<p>James and Oleg will also provide an overview of Red Hat's Open Hybrid
Cloud Architecture and CloudForms' upstream open source community.
Attendees will leave this session with a solid understanding of how to
unify operations management of OpenStack with existing data center
virtualization and public clouds in their organization.</p>

<p>The Gluster community has been working hard to ensure GlusterFS is
integrated with each OpenStack storage interface. With that integration,
as well as the latest VM image management features, GlusterFS 3.4 is now
a first-class citizen of the OpenStack ecosystem.</p>

<p>In this workshop, Eric Harney and John Mark Walker will demonstrate how
to deploy OpenStack with GlusterFS as a scale-out storage platform
<em>today.</em> They will also detail the four major areas of focus for
integration:</p>

<p>Swift: A GlusterFS-backed storage platform has been implemented for the
Swift API using the upstream Swift proxy server/API layer. This provides
a unified storage backend for object as well as POSIX data.</p>

<p>Glance: While it has been possible to use a mounted GlusterFS volume as
the backend data store for Glance for some time, recent development work
has enabled an integrated deployment with Cinder, significantly
increasing the performance for deploying VM images on GlusterFS volumes.</p>

<p>Cinder: A Cinder integration for the Grizzly release added an option for
deploying live VM images on GlusterFS volumes. With recent contributions
to the Havana release, you can now utilize the QEMU - libgfapi
integration that was released in GlusterFS 3.4, greatly improving the
performance of VM image management on GlusterFS.</p>

<p>Libgfapi: With the release of GlusterFS 3.4, the libgfapi client library
is now the standard way to integrate applications with GlusterFS.</p>

<p>Following simple examples, Eric and John Mark will demonstrate:</p>

<p>How to deploy a GlusterFS-backed object storage solution, referencing
when and why you should use this solution in conjunction with or in lieu
of the Swift object storage implementation</p>

<p>How to access the same data via NFS, libgfapi, the GlusterFS client, and
the Swift API</p>

<p>The power and flexibility of Libgfapi</p>

<p>In addition, they will provide a brief GlusterFS roadmap tour,
discussing upcoming enhancements that will benefit OpenStack operators
and developers.</p>

<p>Marconi aims to be pragmatic, building upon the real-world experiences
of teams who have solid track records running and supporting web-scale
message queuing systems. Users can customize Marconi to achieve a wide
range of performance, durability, availability, and efficiency goals.</p>

<p>As a message bus, Marconi allows cloud developers to use a REST API to
easily distribute tasks to multiple workers across the components of an
OpenStack deployment. Publish-subscribe semantics are also supported,
allowing notifications to be distributed to multiple listeners at once.</p>

<p>Join Rackspace's Kurt Griffiths, Principal Architect, and Allan Metts,

<p>This presentation introduces the Havana release's new Modular Layer 2
(ML2) plugin for OpenStack Neutron. The ML2 plugin is a community-driven
framework allowing OpenStack Neutron to simultaneously utilize the
variety of layer 2 networking technologies found in complex, real-world
data centers. ML2 currently works with the Open vSwitch, Linux Bridge,
and Hyper-V L2 agents, and is intended to replace and deprecate those
agents' monolithic plugins. The ML2 plugin also works with SDN
controllers and network hardware devices, and is designed to greatly
simplify adding support for new L2 networking technologies into
OpenStack Neutron.</p>

<p>In this session, Cisco and Red Hat representatives will:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Introduce the Modular Layer 2 (ML2) plugin for OpenStack Neutron</li>
  <li>Provide an overview of ML2, discussing its design principles and
detailing use case examples</li>
  <li>Describe ML2's architecture and its driver APIs</li>
  <li>Demonstrate an OpenStack deployment with ML2 utilizing multiple
segmentation methods and multiple L2 networking mechanisms to show the
power of the ML2 plugin</li>
</ul>

<p>Attendees will leave this session with an understanding of ML2, the use
cases it was designed to solve, how to deploy ML2 in an OpenStack Havana
environment, and how existing Neutron deployments can migrate to ML2.</p>

<p>Earlier this year, Dave Neary presented the theory of personas to
attendees of the OpenStack Summit in Portland. Attendees were excited
about creating a set of personas for the OpenStack project, as they
allow you to have a much clearer idea of your target audience, what
their needs are, and how you can reach them. They also allow much easier
communication around feature discussions, user interface design and
marketing strategy.</p>

<p>Based on data from the user committee survey and user interviews, a
personas working group is being created to answer the question: “Who
uses OpenStack?” In this session Dave will return to present an initial
set of OpenStack personas, discuss how they were created, and detail
what conclusions we can draw from them.</p>

<p>Ceilometer is a tool that collects usage and performance data, while
Heat orchestrates complex deployments on top of OpenStack. Heat aims to
autoscale its deployments, scaling up when they're running hot and
scaling back when idle.</p>

<b>Speaker: Diane Mueller, Krishna Raman</b>
</p>
<p>Just getting a cloud environment up and running is no longer enough. The
challenge that OpenStack faces is how to get people, applications and
services working on OpenStack out of the box and to ensure that the
“unboxing” experience is as seamless and painless as possible.
Organizations expectations for deploying cloud now include being able to
rapidly make services and applications available as soon as they have
IaaS deployed.</p>

<p>To meet the expectations of most organizations, adding a PaaS layer has
become an essential part of every Cloud deployment strategy. The
OpenShift Origin PaaS project is backed by the fastest growing
open-source community of developers, cloud architects, devops, and end
users intent on creating the next generation of PaaS and ensuring that
the tools for deploying, managing &amp; scaling it for OpenStack are freely
available. To do this on OpenStack, the OpenShift community has
“adopted” Heat, OpenStack's orchestration engine, and delivered a set of
Heat templates for deploying, managing and auto-scaling OpenShift on any
OpenStack distribution.</p>

<p>This talk provides an overview of OpenShift, RedHat's Platform as a
Service and a deep dive into deploying OpenShift using Heat, OpenStack's
template language, and a live demonstration of Heat technologies to
deploy AND autoscale OpenShift using repeatable orchestration templates.</p>

<p>We will demonstrate the power of Heat, OpenStack's orchestration engine
and how we leverage Heat to orchestrate cloud infrastructure resources
such as storage, networking, and instances to deploy OpenShift into a
repeatable running environment for OpenStack IaaS platforms.</p>

<p>OpenStack Summit attendees can learn about both the OpenShift Origin
Project, and the emerging Heat template technologies and its impact on
Linux and open source cloud communities.</p>

<p>The speakers are both experienced with live demonstrations, and make the
technical difficulty of this topic easily approachable through real-life
examples.</p>

<p>You've seen Cloud in the press for years, and you have a pretty good
idea of what that means, but what's OpenStack? In this talk, you'll
get the high-level view of what OpenStack is, what all the moving
parts do, and how they fit together. We'll also talk about the
OpenStack Foundation, and how the project is governed.</p>

<p>Topics covered will include:</p>

<ul>
  <li>The various parts of the stack</li>
  <li>How they communicate with one another</li>
  <li>How to spin up an OpenStack private cloud</li>
  <li>How the OpenStack Foundation operates, and a brief history of the project</li>
  <li>How to get involved in the OpenStack project</li>
  <li>What the alternate cloud infrastructure platforms are</li>

<b>Speaker: Brian Proffitt</b>
</p>
<p>The difference between the scale up model used in virtual datacenter management tools 
like oVirt and vSphere and the cloud's scale out model used in OpenStack and CloudStack 
has historially used the pets versus cattle model. But what if there was another way to 
describe how virtual machines are handled in the datacenter or the cloud? In this pop-culture talk, 
Brian Proffitt will expain these concepts and present the idea that it's the starships of Starfleet 
and the fighters of the Empire and the Alliance that can better demonstrate the complexities 
of virtual machine management. Datacenter VMs that scale up are more in line with the starships 
of Starfleet: large, dedicated ships that have an intense amount of investment, not just in 
the ships themselves, but in the crews that man them. These ships are multifunctional, dedicated 
to exploration, defense, and intergalactic troubleshooting. Laden with science labs, weaponry, and 
very diverse crews, these ships are designed to function autonomously in a a variety of situations.
Compare that with the ships of the Empire or the Alliance. Single-purpose ships with a seemingly 
lower investment in crews. On the Empire side, there is very little diversity, with ships and 
weaponry all designed for singular purposes. Empire crews are literally cut from the same cloth, 
and there is very little autonomy on any scale. The Alliance is slightly better, but their ships 
seems aligned to counter the Empire model, and so fall into the same "disposable" model. Crew 
diversity is infinitely better, but the barrier to entry seems a little low ("let's give the kid 
from the sticks an X-Wing fighter with no formal training!"). In many respects, these fictional 
universes represent how VMs are treated in the datacenter and the cloud. This talk will take a 
light-hearted and totally geeked-out approach to discussing VMs in modern IT environments.</p>
