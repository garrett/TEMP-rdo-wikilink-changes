<p><strong>DevOps in a Bi-Modal World (Part 4 of 4)</strong> by James Labocki</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In this series we have seen the complexity of bridging the gap between existing infrastructure and processes (Mode 1) and new, agile processes and architectures (Mode 2). Each brings its own set of challenges and demands on the organization. In Mode-1 organizations are looking to increase relevance and reduce complexity, and in Mode-2 they are looking to improve agility and increase scalability. In this post we will discuss how Red Hat addresses and solves each of these challenges.</p>

<p><strong>Why the Operating System Matters</strong> by Margaret Dawson</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In IT today, we love to note that the infrastructure layer has become commoditized. This started with virtualization, as we could create many virtual machines within a single physical machine. Cloud has taken us further with a key value proposition of delivering cloud services on any standard server or virtualized environment, enabling easier scalability and faster service delivery, among other benefits.</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack Summit Tokyo – Day 0 (Pre-event)</strong> by Jeff Jameson</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I’ve always enjoyed traveling to Tokyo, Japan, as the people are always so friendly and willing to help. Whether it’s finding my way through the Narita airport or just trying to find a place to eat, they’re always willing to help – even with the language barrier. And each time I visit, I see something new, learn another word (or two) in Japanese, and it all just seems new and exciting all over again. Add in the excitement and buzz of an OpenStack Summit and you’ve got a great week in Tokyo!</p>

<p><strong>A Container Stack for OpenStack (Part 1 of 2)</strong> by Joe Fernandes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Open source continues to be a tremendous source of innovation and nowhere is that more evident than at the biannual OpenStack Summit. Over the past couple of years, as OpenStack interest and adoption has grown, we’ve seen another important innovation emerge from the open source community in the form of Linux containers, driven by Docker and associated open source projects. As the world gathers in Tokyo for another OpenStack Summit, we wanted to talk about how Red Hat is bringing these two innovations together, to make OpenStack a great platform for running containerized applications.</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack Summit Tokyo – Day 1</strong> by Jeff Jameson</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Kon’nichiwa from Tokyo, Japan where the 11th semi-annual OpenStack Summit is officially underway! This event has come a long way from its first gathering, more than five years ago, where 75 people gathered in Austin, Texas to learn about OpenStack in its infancy. That’s a sharp contrast with the 5,000+ people in attendance here in what marks Asia’s second OpenStack Summit.</p>

<p><strong>What does RDO stand for?</strong> by Rich Bowen</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The RDO FAQ has long said that RDO doesn't stand for anything. This is a very unsatisfying answer to one of the most frequently asked questions about RDO. So, a little while ago, I started saying that RDO stands for "Rich's Distribution of OpenStack." Although tongue-in-cheek, this response emphasizes that RDO is a community driven project. So it's also Radez's Distribution of OpenStack, and Radhesh's and Russel's and red_trela's. (As well as lots of people whose names don't start with R!)</p>

<p><strong>Proven OpenStack solutions. Simple OpenStack deployment. Powerful results.</strong> by Radhesh Balakrishnan</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>According to an IDC global survey sponsored by Cisco of 3,643 enterprise executives responsible for IT decisions, 69% of respondents indicated that their organizations have a cloud adoption strategy in place. Of these organizations, 65% say OpenStack is an important part of their cloud strategy and had higher expectations for business improvements associated with cloud adoption.</p>

<p><strong>A Container Stack for OpenStack (Part 2 of 2)</strong> Joe Fernandes</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>In Part 1 of this blog series, I talked about how Red Hat has been working with the open source community to build a new container stack and our commitment to bring that to OpenStack. In Part 2 I will discuss additional capabilities Red Hat is working on to build an enterprise container infrastructure and how this is forms the foundation of our containerized application platform in OpenShift.</p>

<p><strong>OpenStack Summit Tokyo – Day 3</strong> by Jeff Jameson</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Hello again from Tokyo, Japan where the third and final day of OpenStack Summit has come to a close. As with the previous days of the event, there was plenty of news, interesting sessions, great discussions on the show floor, and more. All would likely agree that the 11th OpenStack Summit was a rousing overall success!</p>
